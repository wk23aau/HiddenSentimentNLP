 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

The blue alpine loop is comfortable, stylish, and secure—perfect for both fitness activities and casual wear. Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

If you’re looking for a smartwatch that combines rugged durability with advanced features, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is worth every penny. Highly recommended for fitness enthusiasts, adventurers, and anyone seeking a reliable, high-performance smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024"

 Yes yes yes!","This is a must have!!!! The best quality watch I have ever had. It is able to record all my milage for marathon. Battery life lasts 4 days! It does cost a lot of money but defiantly worth it! So many functions and I love that it pairs with my phone and messages. Don’t wait this is worth it!!!","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 A great purchase..","A great watch, fits and looks great with a different band upgrade. The enclosed cloth band was lousy so upgraded to a metal band/case with great results. A bit chunky but a terrific purchase overall, just ditch the enclosed band..","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Operates smoothly only issue noted was seeming to select with active touch when I don’t intend it to sometimes, and this Apple sports band is not the most comfortable if it’s worn somewhat tightly.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Coming from a ver 7 this thing is a beast","The only downside is the band was to small.  They didn't have an option for a larger band.  I've had it a couple of weeks and adding cellular was a game changer.  Didn't even have to contact the cell company it just said its an extra $5.00 a month.  Well worth it.  I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 Yes yes yes!","This is a must have!!!! The best quality watch I have ever had. It is able to record all my milage for marathon. Battery life lasts 4 days!

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model.

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge. Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with. The worst thing is waking up the next day and seeing it didn’t charge at all.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    An excellent upgrade from my series 4","My series 4 Apple Watch was no longer supported by Apple so it was time to upgrade. I love the face size of the ultra, it’s just large enough to be easy to view and small enough to not bother your arm. It looks great and hasn’t scratched yet, I was expecting it to scratch easier than it has. It was all the usual features and functions as the normal series watches with the little bonuses. This watch is spendy but it is great to have 3 days of battery life and a larger screen.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

If you’re looking for a smartwatch that combines rugged durability with advanced features, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is worth every penny. Highly recommended for fitness enthusiasts, adventurers, and anyone seeking a reliable, high-performance smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Coming from a ver 7 this thing is a beast","The only downside is the band was to small.  They didn't have an option for a larger band.  I've had it a couple of weeks and adding cellular was a game changer.  Didn't even have to contact the cell company it just said its an extra $5.00 a month.  Well worth it.  I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful.

Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with. The worst thing is waking up the next day and seeing it didn’t charge at all.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive.

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!

Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost.

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

I watched videos of people reviewing refurbished watches and almost every video said very positive things about it. So I ordered it got here in 4 days and WOW I was surprised to see how good it was it looked like new and the battery is at 100% health. I am very happy with this purchase and I hope I was able to help others before buying a refurbished watch!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge.

Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Very Durable","Wear this watch 99% of the time working on cars, farming etc. Take it off when welding and grinding.  It will pit the screen. I learned on my last watch.

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    An excellent upgrade from my series 4","My series 4 Apple Watch was no longer supported by Apple so it was time to upgrade. I love the face size of the ultra, it’s just large enough to be easy to view and small enough to not bother your arm. It looks great and hasn’t scratched yet, I was expecting it to scratch easier than it has. It was all the usual features and functions as the normal series watches with the little bonuses. This watch is spendy but it is great to have 3 days of battery life and a larger screen.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

If you’re looking for a smartwatch that combines rugged durability with advanced features, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is worth every penny.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now.

Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost.

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

I’m gonna start soon. It also has capability of reading your sleep levels and a bunch of other great fitness tracking apps. I can say that I don’t have any scratches on my screen so great with scratch resistance and just overall the look is amazing. I’ve been using different straps for it and I love it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024"

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge. Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with. The worst thing is waking up the next day and seeing it didn’t charge at all.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

I love the face size of the ultra, it’s just large enough to be easy to view and small enough to not bother your arm. It looks great and hasn’t scratched yet, I was expecting it to scratch easier than it has. It was all the usual features and functions as the normal series watches with the little bonuses.

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

The blue alpine loop is comfortable, stylish, and secure—perfect for both fitness activities and casual wear. Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

If you’re looking for a smartwatch that combines rugged durability with advanced features, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is worth every penny.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now.

Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge. Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days.

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

I love the face size of the ultra, it’s just large enough to be easy to view and small enough to not bother your arm.

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Coming from a ver 7 this thing is a beast","The only downside is the band was to small.  They didn't have an option for a larger band.  I've had it a couple of weeks and adding cellular was a game changer.  Didn't even have to contact the cell company it just said its an extra $5.00 a month.  Well worth it.  I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It does cost a lot of money but defiantly worth it! So many functions and I love that it pairs with my phone and messages.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I need a smartwatch that can keep up with my active lifestyle, and this one delivers.The durable titanium case and toughened sapphire crystal make it perfect for rugged activities like hiking, biking, and swimming.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch.

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I need a smartwatch that can keep up with my active lifestyle, and this one delivers.The durable titanium case and toughened sapphire crystal make it perfect for rugged activities like hiking, biking, and swimming.

The battery life is impressive, and I can easily get through a full day of activity without needing to recharge.The cellular connectivity is a huge plus, allowing me to stay connected and make calls even when I'm far from my phone. The built-in GPS is accurate and reliable, making it perfect for tracking my workouts and exploring new trails.If you're looking for a rugged, durable, and feature-packed smartwatch, I highly recommend the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive.

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

I love the face size of the ultra, it’s just large enough to be easy to view and small enough to not bother your arm.

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

If you’re looking for a smartwatch that combines rugged durability with advanced features, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is worth every penny.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

This watch is spendy but it is great to have 3 days of battery life and a larger screen.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear. The 49mm size provides a clear, vibrant display that’s easy to read in all lighting conditions.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!

Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Coming from a ver 7 this thing is a beast","The only downside is the band was to small.  They didn't have an option for a larger band.  I've had it a couple of weeks and adding cellular was a game changer.  Didn't even have to contact the cell company it just said its an extra $5.00 a month.  Well worth it.  I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 Yes yes yes!","This is a must have!!!! The best quality watch I have ever had. It is able to record all my milage for marathon. Battery life lasts 4 days!

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I need a smartwatch that can keep up with my active lifestyle, and this one delivers.The durable titanium case and toughened sapphire crystal make it perfect for rugged activities like hiking, biking, and swimming.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me. I also like the haptic notice when I am using Apple maps.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase.

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge. Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with. The worst thing is waking up the next day and seeing it didn’t charge at all.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful.

Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”.

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive.

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra.

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part.

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast.

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch.

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Much improved speed over Ultra 1","Had and loved the Ultra 1.., but I did notice some lagging at times when switching apps and playing music.The ultra 2, though it doesn’t have any specific game changing upgrade, is just faster all around. It charges faster, the apps load faster, and it just seems to function better across the board. It’s very durable and the buttons feel sturdy and intuitive. As with all Apple products, very easy to setup and use. Recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days.

But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

 Premium Design, Exceptional Performance, and Unmatched Durability","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is truly a standout smartwatch. The rugged titanium case not only gives it a sleek, high-end appearance but also makes it incredibly durable for outdoor adventures and daily wear.

Its fitness tracking capabilities are top-notch, with Precision GPS ensuring accurate route tracking, even in challenging environments. The action button adds a convenient way to quickly access features, especially during workouts or outdoor activities.

One of the best features is the extra-long battery life, which easily lasts through long hikes or busy days without needing constant recharging. The GPS + Cellular option is great for staying connected without carrying your phone everywhere.

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches.

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Good watch but band is on the small side.","I always felt like the Apple Watch was kind of dainty for my tastes. So I opted to pay more for the Ultra. The watch feels more like something an old school watch person like myself who’s used to dive type watches would wear. It has the weight and feel. Nice size. But the band is barely usable. Too small. Larger men will have to buy a new band before they can wear this.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

    Coming from a ver 7 this thing is a beast","The only downside is the band was to small.  They didn't have an option for a larger band.  I've had it a couple of weeks and adding cellular was a game changer.  Didn't even have to contact the cell company it just said its an extra $5.00 a month.  Well worth it.  I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black. The different color makes it easier to differentiate which watch is which when charging etc.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans. It is very easy to put on with one hand.","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2024"

    Battery life is amazing!","I upgraded from an Apple Watch Series 7 to this one, I wasn't really in need of an upgrade I just got tired of having to charge my watch every single day, and I needed a more durable screen.  As a mechanic I had damaged the screen on every Apple Watch I had owned even with screen protectors.This watch however, battery lasts me 3 days on average, the large screen is awesome to be able to stay up to date on all the important things you set and not have to look at your phone as often, and so far despite being hit or scraped on many things the screen is still flawless, sapphire crystal screens truly are durable.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Best Apple Watch so far","Best Apple Watch that I have owned. Battery life is better than ever and the look is better than the bubble look of the Series watches. It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

I personally don't notice a difference in the size and weight.","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

    Don't let the size scare you","This watch is big and relatively heavy, which is why I took so long to go ahead with the purchase. I have average size wrists, at best, and I was comfortable with the look and feel of my 40mm Series 6.I also balked at the price, but you need to remember it's a titanium body and is also has cellular capability. Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Ultra 2 in black is very good but saves battery at cost of brighness","The changes from the Ultra to the Ultra 2 are small. Apple claims a longer battery life for the Ultra 2. The brightness was set VERY low on the Ultra 2 when it started. Brightness was so low that I worried that I would have to send it back. Turning the brightness up to maximum solved the problem, so it's a keeper.The color is actually dark gray, not black.

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising.

However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch.

The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

It has held up with no sign of wear after a mo th. I like the alpine loop band for comfort but the clasp is hard to work. I switched to the Apple Milanese loop for the ultra 2 and it is much easier to get on at the expense of some comfort. The natural titanium is better than black titanium in my opinion but I’m just tired of black Apple Watches. I only wish I could get the ultra 2 in product red for a change of color once in awhile.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 By far the best watch I’ve ever owned","This device is comprehensively fantastic I would strongly recommend it for anybody who wants an extension of their data collection on their wrist. It is an amazing device and has multiple uses. Don’t expect it to be completely set up out of the box. It takes a lot of customization through the phone, but once you have it the way you want it’s kinda hard to see yourself going back to an analog watch. If you expectation is to charge it pretty much daily you won’t be disappointed in the battery however. The brightness is terrific and sunlight, and it can adjust down to a red light that won’t irritate your light your eyes in the darkness pretty good at accommodating all situations and not being annoying. this premium watch does come at a higher price, but it’s absolutely worth it if you want the best.

My hands down favorite use of this device is the alarm that gently wake you with haptic buzzes before the actual alarm goes off. It has improved my wake up routine tremendously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 Durability & long battery are worth it","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.

A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity. This allows me to leave my iPhone Pro Max at home during runs, providing a sense of freedom and convenience.

The battery life is impressive, comfortably supporting extended workouts and lasting approximately two days under standard use. While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.

I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns. However, the watch’s bulkiness is noticeable, especially when wearing clothing with tight cuffs, which requires some adjustment.

The customizable Action Button is a convenient addition, offering quick access to frequently used apps like the Workout app. Personalizing this button has enhanced its utility, tailoring the watch to my specific needs.

Overall, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 delivers a satisfying experience, combining robust features with user-friendly design, making it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

 It’s clunkier than than the regular sized version","I do a lot of hiking and exercising with this watch for the metrics and the battery life hasn’t disappointed. Definitely better than my series 6 ever was. The GPS and heart rate have been great for me, and consistent. I got the Velcro version of wrist band and have been happy with it even though I had my doubts at first. Surprisingly it hasn’t developed a smell.

My only gripe with this watch is that surprisingly, for me, it catches on things and hits things far more often than my regular iWatch did. It has a wonderful black finish that’s really sharp to look at, but I find that I hit it on things like doorways, door knobs, car doors, desks, where I never did this with my regular iWatch. Just putting a backpack on , or a jacket seems to catch on this thing.

For me, I’ll take the trade off for the battery life.","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024"

 6 month review Perfection","If you're worried is this authentic, the answer is yes. If you're looking for just a GPS version it doesn't exist, but you don't have to have cellular service to use the watch. You can use it via bluetooth only, and it's beautiful. The matte black does not scratch off easily, but you can protect it with moissanite bezels, protective cases plastic or rubber. Different bands make the watch versatile, and the battery life is easily 2 day battery life. You can wear it for 48 hours straight without charging with auto heart rate detection and workout detection, full brightness with sound and haptics on full blast. If you want a black Apple Watch it's a no brainer","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Best electronic watch available at the time","Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.","I wasn't a real Apple person until my daughter-in-law made me join the Apple family. I went all the way and ordered an iPhone 14 and this Apple watch.  The phone is a phone, but I really like this watch.  I was always forgetting my phone and running to find it when I would hear it ring, or just going somewhere without remembering to take my phone. This watch with its LTE function on Verizon (costs $10 a month more with my iPhone line share) has been a blessing.  I no longer worry about keeping my phone with me.

    Love it anyway","I have wanted this for a long time, and since I got a new iPhone I felt I could justify finally getting it.  If love the look of it and the ability to check my heart rhythm.  I guess my bad for not doing more checking to find out that I needed a 3rd part app to use some of the other features.  It does track my sleep, but I question the results since it said I was asleep one night when I had insomnia and moved to the living room recliner to read.  I think maybe the bedtime settings affect its ability there.  For me, being female and not having big arms, it feels very heavy and the watch bands just look way bigger than other watch brand bands.  Those things, along with the weird allergy thing they have going on for a lot of people under the sensor area of the watch (which caused me to have to buy a special cover to stop the itching/breaking out) caused me to rate it 4 stars.  Without the availability of a cover for the sensor I would have had to rate it lower since I would not have been able to wear it.  I still like it better than my Samsung watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    My husband loves his but I couldn’t wear mine.","The Apple Watch Ultra 2 fits comfortably on my husband’s wrist, but it was much too large for me and pushed too deeply into my smaller, bonier wrist.If you have a small, thin wrist I would recommend going with the smaller version.I had to return my watch back in October because the screen wasn’t responding to taps, and the watch was alerting me that I haven’t moved in a while at 5AM when I was sleeping. It wasn’t recording and marking exercise segments correctly either. I think I had a bad unit because my husband’s watch was doing everything correctly (we bought both at the same time).The watch was returned, then received by Amazon on October 25. It’s December 1 and I’m still waiting for the refund for the watch and the AppleCare+ plan. I would not recommend buying Apple products through Amazon for that reason. Buy from Apple directly so you don’t get dragged around waiting for the refund. Now they’re telling me the refund takes 60 days and the refund tracking says it’s “stuck in processing”. If I’d purchased directly from Apple I could’ve just taken it to the Apple Store for much faster service.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Really adjusting to it","Coming from a Garmin fenix 7 pro to this is a pretty big change. Battery life is much shorter. I’m getting around 3.5 days. While the fenix delivers 21 days regular use. Introducing this into the apple ecosystem was a breeze. Everything is connected. The display is phenomenal and the customizable features are paramount. Not going to give up on the Garmin for extended expeditions. This watch is sharp looking and perfect for daily wear and exercise monitoring especially for the cardiovascular and exercise parameters. Charges fast and gives you the ability to control certain apps and activities to extend battery life. All and all I was skeptical about purchasing It. I saw it came in black so purchased it. You can get the natural titanium and put a black case on it and then you have the color option . Able to send receive messages and calls. Pretty convenient. So far I’m really enjoying this watch. Oh yeah the dive app is pretty cool also.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Was iffy but very satisfied! Recommending.","I had an SE watch and I was becoming unsatisfied that it would be at 40% by the time I got home in the evening from work. What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say "We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at." You can even use the "Backtrack" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a "Where did I park my car?" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a "Siren" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch. I am grateful that I was able to use Affirm for this purchase and only pay $49 a month, otherwise, I would never have been able to get it.(PS - The images wouldn't load, but that's okay)","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    Welcome to Apple Watch!","I had decided a long time ago to be an Apple hater.  I couldn't help myself...but I am today the proud owner of an Apple Watch Ultra 2 and also an iPhone 15 Pro Max (but that's another story).  I absolutely love this watch.  I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in August 2024 and this sent me searching for the best watch I could find with health related features.  That for me was the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  I use the health features daily to track my heart and also my sleep.  And that alone made the purchase reasonable for me.  Now, if Apple can just get that lawsuit resolved maybe I can get access to the O2 feature too!  But if not, the patent will be up in 2028 and I'll get it then...if I live that long!  ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

    Great device, just don't try as 2nd device on Verizon","So monumentally frustrated right now. Bought this as a second cell device to complement my Ultra 1 watch, expecting that as Verizon advertises, it's capable of cell service and full device support on their service.Found after more than a dozen hours of support runaround that Verizon cannot set the Ultra 2 as a standalone device on their service, only as Number Share - if you don't have another watch setup for that - or Family Share with reduced app utilization/access, which is not acceptable to me, esp. because I depend on numerous apps for business.They're currently not able to set up any Ultra 2 as a standalone device, despite their claims, which is utterly ridiculous they advertise a service they cannot provide. Nor can you set the Ultra 2 up as Number Share, because then the Ultra 1 won't as a standalone.So, I wasted $750 for nothing, unless I can get one of the other providers to support two Ultra watches.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

    Love this watch","Upgrading from an Apple Watch 8. I love this Ultra 2 in titanium. I found a nice Milanese-style band with a magnetic catch. I wanted a very breathable band, and the magnetic catch makes the band infinitely adjustable. That's the tradeoff I was willing to make since I know it messes with the compass which I almost never use.I didn't like how my AW8 handled phone calls. This Ultra 2 is great for phone calls. It's very clear, and unlike my AW8, I get no complaints about dropped calls or unexpected silences. I thought I would use the cellular feature but it turns out, the watch does everything I need without using cellular, as long as my iPhone is on me, near me or somewhere in the house.I love the modular face and the fact that it dims the full color display to red in dim light.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

Plus, there's the Action button and a few other perks not found on the Series 10 and earlier models.Then there's the battery life. I've been wearing mine for 12 hours today and the battery is at 85%.FWIW, I found the Ocean Band to be clunky and the other Apple bands to be even worse. So I ordered the four-pack of Odbeai bands from Amazon and am extremely happy with them. They are at least as good as the original Apple bands, at a fraction of the cost. I have to wonder who at Apple thought it was reasonable to charge $100++ for a silly watch band.","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024"

    Put it off for years… worth the wait.","I considered many versions of Apple Watches, but never saw enough pluses, or lack of minuses, to get me to buy one. Having to charge every day was a hurdle I couldn’t get past.  I’ve used Fitbit Sense watches for several years, and they provide an average 4 days of charge, though far less integration with my iPhone.I purchased a Series 9 watch for my wife as a Christmas gift, also her first Apple Watch.  She loves it, and has told me often I needed one. So when I broke the face of my watch, I researched Apple (again) and found the Ultra 2. On paper, it had all I needed and much more than I currently had.  Free shipping and returns, so I tried it.I’m glad I waited for this model.  The larger face fits my wrist without looking clownish, the screen keeps all I need to see without having to delve into menus. Like my phone, I can just ask Siri to open apps, send messages, make calls, or start a timer. And it lasts at least 3 days on a charge, so health metrics include sleep data.Compared to a good standard watch, it’s not overly expensive.  It can do more than I’ll need, but more importantly does what I want. So far it is the best watch I’ve ever owned. If anything happens to change that, I’ll be back here to let you know.Easy 5 Stars for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

    10/10 my favorite!!","I was a a hardcore Fitbit person for years and it wasn’t until my Fitbit stopped working on iPhone that I swapped. I’ve used Apple Watches for about 4 years now and this one is absolutely my favorite. It charges so fast, I just hate having to remember to click “charging to full” once it hits 80%. The ease of texting on this watch is way better. I always have a screen protector which I think are made way better for this device over others. The fitness tracker is so nice.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

    Had low hope but immediately changed!","I ordered a refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 because a friend of mine said that it was cheaper but also no difference to a new one. I watched videos of people reviewing refurbished watches and almost every video said very positive things about it. So I ordered it got here in 4 days and WOW I was surprised to see how good it was it looked like new and the battery is at 100% health. I am very happy with this purchase and I hope I was able to help others before buying a refurbished watch!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    Best Upgrade","I owned an apple watch for almost 4 years. After it cracked along the side while I was rock climbing the issue slowly got worse until the watch slowed down and became much less useful. The battery was already kind of dead and it had already seen like 7 years of life total between me and my brother. I have always used it for the amazing exercise tracking, and the ability to listen to music/podcasts on the go without my phone. I upgraded to the Ultra 2 last week, and it was an instant change!!!!!!The battery alone makes the device worthwhile (especially if you use it for exercise and sleep), but I’m finding new use cases every day with the much larger display and veritable trove of options available to me compared to my old hand me down model. The cost is kind of an instant drawback, but if you have always been a fan of the design then I personally think it is worth the money.","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024"

    Apple Watch","The charging speed is amazing great value for the money it’s really easy to use. It’s got a huge screen very clear. I don’t use the fitness tracker as much as I’d like to.

    2nd time purchasing one","Iwatches have become a staple for my day to day. Having two allows me to charge one and swap at night or the next am. Generally can go a few days on one charge. Recommend getting a charging station so you can just set it down for a charge. Find a charging station the let’s it lay flat ideally (horizontally) since the other chargers can be annoying to get a solid connection with. The worst thing is waking up the next day and seeing it didn’t charge at all.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

The battery life is impressive, and I can easily get through a full day of activity without needing to recharge.The cellular connectivity is a huge plus, allowing me to stay connected and make calls even when I'm far from my phone.

    Great watch - defective trail loop band","The watch itself is great, check other reviews for details. The band that came with it was defective - did not slide properly into the channel and ended up getting stuck, had to go to Apple’s Genius Bar and they verified that the band is defective, they’re getting me a new one. Did not want to return through Amazon as it’s a high dollar item, and Amazon doesn’t protect customers these days. Feel like they would have declined return due to open box or something, despite defective part. Anyway, it was just a hassle, so I’d suggest buying at the Apple Store and opening it in front of them just in case.","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Was worth the upgrade from 1st ultra for me!","I was in the market for a “quick release” band for a very long time but I never pulled the trigger on one so once Apple released this ultra 2 with a titanium quick release band I had to cop. The screen in brighter than the ultra 1 and the GPS is better as well those are the main differences. I’m very active so I wanted the brighter screen and better gps for outdoor exercising. The black on black is a very nice touch as it looks less “apple watchish” and more sleek in my experience.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2024"

    Love it","If you are outdoorsy and can’t give up the Apple ecosystem than this watch is for you. Now if you are a serious runner I highly recommend getting a garmin for performance. That will be my next purchase but this watch is still fantastic. The running data can be slightly off, the lack of being able to upload custom workouts is rather sad, and also Apple is seeking to personally destroy my self confidence by telling me my vo2 max is around ten points lower than my true lab tested vo2 max. However, the build is fantastic, the texting function is superb, accessibility is glorious, and sleep tracking data is just the best.","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

    Comfortable Beyond Expectation","I'm amazed and impressed with how comfortable this watch is. When I first picked it up, my initial assumption was that because it's quite a bit heavier (and thicker) than what I'm use to, that it would feel bulky, and that it would shift around too much. But the opposite is true, as because of the slightly convex shape of the bottom, and the great stap it comes with, it feels more like it's not even there. Also, much more comfortable to wear sleeping than my old Garmin watch. I also assumed that it would not be comfortable while on bike rides, but again, not the case at all.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    The last watch you’ll need","I’ve had several Apple Watches and liked all of them.  Everyone of them I’ve always thought, if this one would do a & b it be great or x & y would be cool. The Ultra 2 is the a-z of watches. Honestly I can’t think of anything that would make it cooler , more user friendly, interactive, intuitive etc. Its battery life is wonderful and wished they’d incorporate the same technology into their phones. The size , options and function are pretty close to perfect. If you’re on the fence about buying get off the fence. You won’t be disappointed and as the prices decrease awaiting the Ultra 3 pull the trigger on the Ultra 2 since the savings will be a bonus and can’t imagine they can add anything that would make the 2 any better… the buyers remorse never kicks in on the purchase. just do it.","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024"

    Just works and is comfortable","I like this watch band. I think it is functional and attractive. It is very adjustable. The band can be tighter or loser where it goes through the slot of the watch. It can also be tighter or loser when you hook it. It is slightly stretchy due to the design of the loops to hook through without using elastic(I believe). The material also seems very strong. It is much more adjustable than a standard watch band with holes. The material seems more breathable and less sticky than plastic or leather. The blue looks good with jeans.
