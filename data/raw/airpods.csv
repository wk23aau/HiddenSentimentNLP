 Solid upgrade","The AirPods 4 offer a blend of convenience and enhanced audio performance, making them a compelling choice for both new users and those upgrading from earlier models.

Design and Comfort

The AirPods 4 maintain Apple's signature sleek design, with a compact case that's easy to carry. The earbuds fit comfortably in the ears, suitable for extended use without discomfort. However, as with any universal fit, individual comfort may vary.

Audio Performance

Compared to the AirPods 3, the AirPods 4 deliver a richer bass experience, enhancing the overall sound quality. While the midrange and treble remain clear, the added bass depth provides a more balanced listening experience. It's important to note that while the sound quality is improved, it may not match the depth and clarity of higher-end models like the AirPods Pro 2.

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)

A significant addition to the AirPods 4 is Active Noise Cancellation. Users have reported that the ANC is effective, especially considering the open-ear design without silicone tips. While it may not completely isolate external noise as efficiently as in-ear models, it provides a noticeable reduction in ambient sounds, making it suitable for everyday environments.

Microphone and Call Quality

The microphone quality is adequate for phone calls, capturing voices clearly in quiet settings. However, in noisier environments, the microphone may struggle to filter out background noise, which can affect call clarity.

Battery Life and Charging

The AirPods 4 offer up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, providing ample usage between charges. The inclusion of a USB-C charging case aligns with modern charging standards, offering faster and more convenient recharging options.

Pricing and Value

Priced at $179, the AirPods 4 with ANC sit between the standard AirPods and the AirPods Pro 2. While they offer several enhancements over the standard model, including ANC and improved sound quality, potential buyers should consider whether these features meet their specific needs, especially when compared to the higher-priced AirPods Pro 2.

Conclusion

The Apple AirPods 4 are a commendable upgrade, offering improved audio performance, effective ANC, and a comfortable design. They are particularly well-suited for users seeking a balance between price and features without venturing into the premium tier. However, those requiring top-tier noise cancellation and audio fidelity might still prefer the AirPods Pro 2.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 A Major Upgrade – Totally Worth It!","I recently got these Apple AirPods 4 for my girlfriend to upgrade from her Gen 2, and the difference is absolutely night and day! The sound quality is crystal clear, and the personalized spatial audio really enhances the listening experience, making it feel like you're right in the middle of the action. The sweat and water resistance is a great addition, especially since she likes to work out with them, and they hold up perfectly during exercise.

The USB-C charging is a nice touch as well, making it easier to charge with the same cable she uses for her other devices. Overall, these AirPods are a fantastic choice if you're looking for an upgrade or a gift. The sound quality, comfort, and features make them totally worth the investment.","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025"

 Really like these airpods!","I really like these airpods. The sound quality is really amazing once you can control the volume and you can also personalize the audio which is something that I also like. The Clarity is good, they are comfortable once you get them adjusted in your ears. The functionality but a downside to these is that they don't come with a charging cable in the box when you get them. You will need to either use your own or if buy yourself one.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025"

 Good, but not perfect","I've used the 2nd generation for years and loved them. Since they were discontinued I decided to try these. I like them, they fit snuggly in my ears and sound a bit better than my previous set. They charge fast and I like that they use the standard charger cord this time instead of the special gen 2 cord. I haven't had any problems with connecting which was a regular problem with my gen 2 set. They seem well made. Since, I use these with an android phone so I can't speak to the other features that I don't have access to. However, there are a couple things that I don't like. One is the way the ear buds fit in the case which is awkward and sometimes difficult to get them in and out. The second and biggest is the button placement on the stems which makes it quite difficult to hang up a call. The tap feature from gen 2 was way better and easier to use.","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025"

 Kid loves 'em","The world's best dad here: my teen didn't care about anything else he got for Christmas except these airpods/ibuds/whatever-they're-called. Now he doesn't have to pretend he can't hear me. It's especially fun when I'm talking to him and don't realize he's wearing them and I have to repeat myself. So 5 stars for "noise" cancelling, whether they have that feature or not. They're also usb-c so I get an extra 3 minutes of quality time with him each day as he's unplugging my charging cable to bring to his room. As a bonus it gives me a valid reason to enter his room to retrieve my cable while being reminded why I never stepped foot in there to begin with. Of course with teens they're awkward and clumsy so they've bounced a few times off the driveway. Astonishingly it's survived each tumble flawlessly. He loves them and never leaves the house without them. I guess they're teen approved, so they must be good. Well, good enough to have me labeled by an ornery teen as "the best dad in the world"","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025"

 The best AirPods you can buy now!","I have tested Pro, 3rd and 4th generations. This one is amazing in all aspects. Sound is better than 3rd, but not as good as Pro. But I do not like in ear plugs.
My pair arrived in perfect condition, sealed and not activated. This one was purchased as a gift to my wife. I will buy same for me as soon as my 3rd generation will die))","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025"

 Great Quality","I needed Bluetooth headphones and wanted a pair that’s would last. I chose the Apple AirPods 4 based on my experience with Apple product quality. They work seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad and sound great. The only reason i give it 4 stars is the fact that the case does not charge wirelessly. It is a minor inconvenience, but nonetheless it’s an inconvenience. I just think Apple missed the boat on this feature. You can buy $20 Bluetooth headphones that have this feature. Having said that I am very satisfied with the overall quality.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

 Good, but the ones with ANC are worth the extra $","So I've had the old Airpods (2nd gen) for years, and they finally started giving out, so decided to try the 4s. At first, I wasnt that impressed. They sounded about the same as my Airpod 2s did while sitting in a quiet environment. HOWEVER, when i took them into the tanning booth (where theres a loud fan sound), I could still very much hear the sound of the tanning fan, and had to raise the volume on the Airpod 4s to almost full volume in order to drown out the sound. Comparing that to my old Airpod 2s, which did a solid job at blocking out that tanning fan sound, I was definitely not impressed.

HOWEVER.. Before returning them, I decided to see if maybe there was a setting I could change that would make them sound better somehow. Eventually I realized I had the Spatial Audio/Head Tracking setting ON, which meant that whenever I would look away from my phone, the sound would adjust and would make it seem like whatever ear was closest to my phone would hear sound the loudest. I didnt see the point of this, so I turned the head tracking setting OFF and kept it at the "Fixed" Spatial Audio setting. This seemed to improve the sound quality quite a bit, ESPECIALLY when I discovered songs in Apple Music had certain music with Dolby Atmos/Spatial Audio sound. Normally, I'm a Spotify guy, but when I'm listening with Airpods, I'll prob use Apple Music from now on.

TLDR: Once I turned off the Head Tracking Spatial Audio, they sounded good. However, I still wasnt happy with the outer noise I was able to hear while wearing them compared to the Airpods 2. I ultimately upgraded to the Airpods 4 with Active Noise Cancelling, and those will be getting 5 stars from me.","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

 Can’t Beat the Price!","At $99 ($106 after taxes) at the time of purchase it was a steal.

I don’t need anything too fancy. As long as the sound is good and I can listen to my music or podcasts on my commute to/from work, at the gym, taking a walk or just simply out for a few hours and they last without them cutting off then I’m a happy camper.

This is my third pair of AirPods I’ve bought. The first pair were the AirPod 2s which I bought back in 2019 and again in 2020 after I thought I had lost them (which later I found) and so unfortunately/fortunately for me, before I could cancel the order, they were shipped and I simply kept them as a backup pair.

Only recently did my first pair of AirPods 2 finally need to be thrown out because they would no longer last on a full charge, so now I’m using my backup pair of AirPod 2s.

These AirPod 4s are more or less another backup pair and as my title suggests the price was right to purchase. So when my second pair of AirPod 2s no longer last on a full charge, I don’t have to worry about replacing them because I’ll already have a pair of these AirPod 4s.

So as long as the price is right, I’ll always try to have an extra pair.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025"

    I’m happy with my purchase!","I was a little worried ordering these off of Amazon. However, Seems to be the real deal. Also seem to be brand new. There wasn’t any signs of a previous owner. Everything was wrapped and packaged as new. Connected to my phone without any issues. At first only one headphone would play sound and I was worried one was faulty but turned out it was a setting that needed fixed. Everything works great so far. I was a little disappointed that the AirPods were just thrown in a larger box and were just rattling around on their way to me, no bubble wrap or anything to protect them from damage.  Other than that I have no complaints. I’ll be back in a couple months to update my review!","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

    Nice headphones","These stay in my ears pretty well, for normal activities so I mostly use them for traveling and not working out since a lot of sweat from the ears usually makes AirPods go bad and they tend to fall out if I’m doing heaving running exercises. Don’t really need the noise cancelling feature as it doesn’t provide much benefits for me for the higher price. These work just fine. These charge really fast and connect easily to your iPhone.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

    Long Overdue","I've tried so many different earbuds and headsets, because I didn't want to pay a lot for them.  I finally decided to spend the money and purchase the AirPods,  I should have bought these instead of all the others I purchased.  They sound incredible with great range from bass to treble, the clarity is amazing.  I barely took them out of the box, and they prompted my iPhone to set them up before I could read the instructions - very easy to connect and use right away.  They are lightweight and hardly notice they are in my ears as they are quite comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025"

    Slightly larger and don't fit quite as well","I have loved the fit and sound quality of the original Apple ear buds and airpods for years.  I can wear them all day and forget I'm wearing  them.I cannot wear any style ear buds that have the suction cup ear canal inserts, so the Apple air pods are perfect for me.I bought these to replace a set I lost.  I wanted the USB-C port and the newer generation technology.They are still easy to use, have great sound quality and much better nattery life than the previous generationls.However they have changed the size and shape to where these don't want to stay in my ear as easily as the older versions.  I still like them very much, but they can at times want to pop out on me.","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2025"

    I want to love them","I want to love them but I’ve always had an issue with AirPods falling out of my ears and not fitting properly. I’ve had the 2nd gen and these, and the 2nd gen would fly out my ears so much to the point where they just started falling apart from hitting the ground so often.  I wish Apple would create some type of over the ear holder for them since we’re already paying an arm and a leg for some ear plugs that might not last for some due to how often they fall out.  But overall the sound quality is good, and they charge pretty quickly, I guess I’ll just have to figure out my own way to keep them from falling out of my ears.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

For sound quality, I would say they're marginally better than previous ear pods but I have yet to try the personalized sound feature. Without changing any settings they were perfectly fine for me. So far I have zero complaints and recommend them to anyone wanting bluetooth ear pods.","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025"

 Great ANC in a comfortable, portable package","If you're an Apple fan, you've probably already put these in your cart, regardless of reviews. But I am not an Apple fan. In fact, I kind of hate the brand for a plethora of reasons and would not own any of their devices in a perfect world. However, my philosophy is to purchase items that are the best at what I need them for, regardless of brand. Keeping this in mind, I can say that I am very happy with my 4th gen Airpods with ANC. If you are looking for an actual review of this item from someone without the Apple-colored glasses on, keep reading.

I bought the 2nd gen Airpods (not the pros) in 2020 because they were pretty much the best true wireless, non in ear earbuds in the market at that time. The "non in ear" part is the biggest requirement for me. My 2020 Airpods have lasted me 4+ years so far, even after I dropped one in water. They're still working great and I have no need to replace them, but I wanted to get a new, upgraded pair and then I can keep the 2020 ones in my bag at all times as a backup.

When I saw that these had ANC, I was skeptical but excited. I have Bose headphones for ANC like when I'm working or on a flight, and honestly having ANC has been great. But Bose headphones are big and clunky and uncomfortable, all things that make them not the greatest for daily use. Reviews for these Airpods said the ANC was pretty good, so I decided to pay the little bit extra and get them. Worse case was that I would never use the ANC and I'd have just overpaid for the same product but 4 years newer. Luckily, best case happened and that is that I am very happy with my purchase and use the ANC modes all the time.

I know not everyone is a fan of the fit of non in ear earbuds like the Airpods have, but for me it's great. In ear earbuds hurt my ears in just a few minutes. Earpod style earbuds (where it points into your ear canal but doesn't insert in) are much more comfortable. The earbud part on these are a bit larger than my 2nd gen Airpods, but still fit decently. They feel pretty stable in/on my ear for my day to day usage, but I don't think I would trust them to stay put for vigorous exercises like running or jogging.

The ANC is fantastic. I wore these on a plane recently and when I had previously flown with my Bose headphones, the ANC made loud popping and crackling noises from time to time, and especially on take off and landing. But the Airpods' ANC did not do that at all. They cancel out outside noise very well, just as well as my Bose headphones, and have less of a "eardrum pressure" feeling than my Boes headphones do.

I like the multiple ANC modes. It has off, on, transparent, and adaptive. Off means it's just normal earbuds, on filters out almost all outside noise, and transparent lets in all the extra noise so you can hear (similar to open ear headphones like bone conduction ones).

Adaptive mode is great. You may think that it will dynamically choose the level of noise you get based on the name, but it doesn't do that actually. There is a "conversation awareness" feature you can turn on or off that can reduce noise and amplify speech, but it only activates after *you* talk, instead of if someone talks to you. The way the adaptive mode works instead is that you can select the level of noise that you want allowed in. This is great because I have it tuned so I don't hear environmental noises like the dehumidifier, heater, or my roommate working, but I can hear her talk. While using my Airpods with adaptive mode on a recent flight, I could hear the announcements and flight attendants, but the engine sound was greatly reduced and I could hear my music.

Audio in general sounds pretty good. I'm no audiophile by any means, but I know what good quality sounds like. The profile to me is pretty flat, and with a basic EQ I'm able to get the sound I like. There's not too much lag between video and audio, but there's a very noticeable gap for a split second when you first start playing audio after having none playing. For example, a Slack notification on my Macbook might pop up, and then a second or two later the notification sound will play through my airpods. I've seen this same behavior in other Bluetooth headphones and earbuds so I guess it must be a technical limitation or a side effect of some sort of standby state on the connection.

Battery life is pretty good. I went about 5-6 hours recently with ANC Adaptive mode on and music playing before I got a low battery bleep. My gen 2 Airpods could go a bit longer, and I'm guessing these have longer battery life if I were to turn off ANC. The case keeps you charged quickly on the go, and the case itself charges pretty fast. Plus it charges with USB C now, thank god. Practically everything in my life uses C now, except those gen 2 Airpods which use Lightning. I'm glad the EU made Apple finally add C.

The controls now require you to squeeze the stem of the airpods instead of tapping like the gen 2 ones. Because I haven't had the gen 3 Airpods or any of the pro models, maybe that's the way it's been for a while, but honestly I preferred tapping to pause or change songs. I was able to change the squeeze speed at least because it was a bit cumbersome at first and I kept dislodging my earbud before I got used to it.

The Airpods work well with my Android (Pixel) phone, and really there's no loss in functionality when using them with my phone or PC vs an Apple device. I think the only 2 features that I can't use is 1) use Siri with them (ohhh noooo however will I survive) and 2) pause my music automatically when I remove an earbud (oh well). But all of the various settings and tweaks can really only be changed using an iPad, iPhone, or Mac. I luckily have an iPad (best tablet for digital art) and Macbook (very nice experience for coding or watching movies) so I set them up there, but you can also just use a friend's device or probably a demo model at a store. There are some apps for Android that allow you to make some tweaks, but as of Jan 2025 I think only one of them has partial support for 4th gen Airpods with ANC. With my Pixel, phone calls are clear sounding for both me and who I'm talking to.

Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. I do think they're overpriced (as is everything from Apple), but I also think that based on the 2 months I've been using them, they've been worth the money. If these last 4 years too, then they'll be beyond worth it. If you are looking for ANC non in ear earbuds with good sound and decent battery life, these are in my opinion the best choice.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Sound great with surprisingly good noise “cancelling”","Bass is great, microphones are great, charging case is compact. Everything feature and sound-wise about these is pretty great for the price. The only question mark is with noise cancellation since these don’t have the in-hear tips that AirPods Pro have to truly seal out sound. You’d think the noise cancellation would be bad or nonexistent, but no; it works pretty good. I work in a warehouse with loud forklifts and smashing hammers and dropped pallets, and with noise cancellation turned on, I can definitely still hear everything, but the loudness in severely reduced. And in fact, I might even say the fact that the noise cancellation is a step below the Pro is a feature. Being in a warehouse, for safety, I can’t block out ALL sound, but loudness reduction is appreciated. And to be quite honest, with ANC on and the volume somewhat up, it easy to erase sound around. Even if you don’t work in this type of environment, blocking out a lot of sound so that you can then listen to media at a lower volume is good for ear health. My biggest issue is the fit: they’re constantly falling out of my ears hour 2 or 3, and it’s exacerbated by me chewing gum and regularly looking up and down my inventory racks. Even given that, I 100% recommend AirPods 4. These are really great.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2025"

These on the other hand Function and work great they never come out of my ear even when i’m sweating or doing alot of moving. they seat so well and don’t irritate me or hurt my ears at all. the durability i’m not so sure of i try and take care of my stuff even tho im rough and clumsy i’ve only dropped them a few times case, and buds but so far nothing bad has happend so id say they are pretty durable for what they are you shouldn’t be doing anything else with them to damage them and blame it on durability. volume control is really nice and they sound amazing like really really good bass and everything. the noise cancellation works so well i work in a heavy duty diesel mechanic shop and when i have them in and there could be 20 diesel trucks running while people are working on them and i cant hear a thing if my music is up. charging is what you would expect its wireless or type c plug its very easy to charge and fast","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

I love the noise cancellation feature and the transparency feature to be able hear music and surroundings since I do work outside. It has plenty of comfort and doesn’t hurt your ears and the functionality is really great. The volume control and change songs is also great.

Only downside so far is the battery life. It seems to only last about 4 hours give or take. Wish it would be at least 5-6 hours since the other pairs I had was that and that would last at least half my work shift

Overall can’t go wrong with them","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 Best earphones I’ve ever used.","These are the best earphones I’ve ever had. And to be honest, they’re up there with some of the best headphones I’ve ever had. The noise cancellation is really really good. The transparency mode works well. The adaptive noise filter works well. The conversation detect works well. The sound quality from these headphones is fantastic. I had the third generation AirPods and I loved them. But these are better in every way and fit in my ears even better. I can wear these for a longer time before my ears start to feel funny. Also, they just have a better fit for me. I have zero complaints about these headphones. The craziest part to me is how much more beautiful so many songs sound. Songs that I’ve listened to hundreds of times before. But with these AirPods, I swear I hear notes and tones and instruments that I never noticed before in many songs. Especially some of the grunge, post grunge, and alternative rock songs from the mid 90s. Listening to Anna Molly by Incubus in these things was intense haha.

I hate rubber / silicone tips so I could never use the Pro versions. I’m amazed that these have noise cancellation without the nibs. It’s seriously stellar.","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025"

 impressive features, okay value","First, the sound quality is fantastic. The bass is punchy, and the mids and highs are clear and balanced. I’ve used them for everything from music to podcasts, and they perform really well in both scenarios. The addition of Adaptive Audio really helps customize the listening experience depending on your environment, whether you’re in a noisy area or a quiet space. Transparency Mode is another feature I enjoy—it allows you to hear your surroundings while still listening to music, which is really useful when I’m out walking or running errands.

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works well, though I wouldn’t say it’s as strong as some of the top-tier over-ear headphones I’ve used. It does a good job of blocking out typical ambient noise, but in environments like crowded cafes or airplanes, you may still hear some background sounds. That said, for day-to-day use, it’s definitely a solid ANC experience.

The Personalized Spatial Audio feature is neat, especially for movies or shows. It creates a more immersive experience, as if the sound is coming from around you. It’s not something I use all the time, but when I do, it adds an extra layer of depth to the audio.

The fit of the AirPods 4 is comfortable, and I appreciate that they come with different ear tips to help get a better seal. They’re also lightweight, which makes them great for long listening sessions. The battery life is impressive too, easily lasting through a few hours of use before needing a recharge. The new USB-C charging case is a great update, making it much easier to charge them with the same cable I use for my other devices. The wireless charging feature is also super convenient.

That said, while these AirPods perform excellently in terms of sound quality, comfort, and convenience, I do feel like the price tag might be a bit high for some. I’ve used other wireless earbuds with similar features, and they’re often more affordable. While you’re definitely getting quality here, the premium price might not feel entirely justified for some users.

In the end, I would definitely recommend these to anyone who’s an Apple ecosystem user or someone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. However, if you’re on a budget or don’t need all the high-end features, there are alternatives out there that offer a similar experience at a lower price point.","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    A worthy upgrade to the classic AirPod","I can’t get over how well the noise cancellation works—It’s magic! If you’ve had AirPods in the past you will love these. AirPods are literally the only ear buds I can wear due to my tiny and sensitive ear canals (anything with a silicone tip, like the Pros, is an instant no sadly). I was a bit concerned that the newer shape wouldn’t be as comfortable as the original, but I’ve had no issues with it at all. Like any Apple product, it plays well with other Apple products. Set up is instantaneous and there are a good amount of options for spacial audio and you can change the noise cancellation anytime from the control center. Like I said if you’ve been happy with earlier AirPods models, this is a no-brainer!","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

    One of my best tech purchases!","Let me just say AirPods 4 are absolutely amazing...probably the best piece of tech I have ever purchased. First, the noise cancellation is absolutely amazing. When you first put the AirPods 4 in your ears, the noise cancellation initiates even before you put music or anything else on. It's absolutely amazing. Now when I travel by commuter rail, subway, go to the gym, walk near a busy street, the noise cancellation drowns everything out and I can hear music or whatever else I have on much better. Sometimes I just put the AirPods 4 in just for the noise cancellation but not play any music or anything. And second, the sound is much better than AirPods 3, base very strong. Without a doubt, one of the best tech purchases I have ever made. These are amazing!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2025"

    Comfortable and lightweight!","I bought these to have an extra pair at work and my Bose earbuds for home.  I’m finding myself using the AirPods more because of how comfortably they fit in my ears.  However, I wished the sound quality was more like my Bose QuietComfort II earbuds.  Also, the sound emitting from the AirPods is not as quiet as my Bose earbuds.  Whatever music I’m listening to, others can hear it around me.  Comparing my AirPods to my Bose QuietComfort II earbuds, the sound isn’t quiet, but I’ll give it 4 stars because they feel comfortable in my ears and are so compact to carry anywhere.  As for the noise cancellation, it is excellent!  I always ask the person I'm talking to if they can hear the loud music playing in the background, and they would reply that they can't hear it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

    Great Airpods","I recently upgraded to the AirPods 4, and I couldn’t be more impressed. These have quickly become my go-to headphones for daily use. Here’s what I love about them:Sound Quality: The audio is crisp and clear, with a surprising amount of bass for such small earbuds. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the sound is always rich and well-balanced.Comfort and Fit: I was initially concerned about the fit, as I have slightly smaller ears, but these AirPods are surprisingly comfortable. They sit securely without feeling too tight, and I can wear them for hours without discomfort.Battery Life: The battery life is outstanding. I get about 6 hours of listening time on a full charge, and the charging case gives me multiple recharges throughout the day. It’s also super easy to charge with the Lightning port or wireless charging.","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2025"

    Exactly as expected! (A subjective review, duh)","I never take the time to write reviews because why spend so much time on something that will ultimately have no effect on my life? Well in this case, these Airpods have met and exceeded every single one of my expectations and I figured that was worth writing about.Important disclaimers:- OF COURSE this is a subjective opinion, because that is all a review is. Take it with a grain of salt.- Different products work better or worse for different people, it's just that simple.- When talking about noise cancelling headphones, it's important to consider them for what they are, not what we think they SHOULD be.THE FIT:OKAY. I am someone who has very small ear cannals. I have spent years trying to find earbuds that fit my ears comfortably. Silicone in-ear tips have always been extremely uncomfortable for me. That being said, I did own the first gen Airpods Pro for a couple of years before buying these Airpods 4. I wanted earbuds that I could exercise with, use for commuting, and use for blocking out sound when I'm at school or on an airplane. The airpods pro fit the bill, but I could only wear them for short periods of time before they would start to seriously hurt. On top of that, they would always slowly come out of my ears. It didn't matter what size of eartips I used. My ears are just NOT made for in-ear silicone tips. BUT THESE AIRPODS 4!!! Holy smokes they are so comfortable. They never fall out. I can wear them for hours at a time and not even notice them. I haven't worn a pair of Airpods this comfortable since the gen 2 Airpods. The 3's didn't work for me either, but somehow apple really cooked up the ideal fit for these Airpods 4.THE NOISE CANCELLATION:Okay. Obviously, these are NOT going to have the same level of noise reduction as in-ear earbuds because there is no seal created by any silicone tips. If Airpods Pros and silicone tips have always worked for you, just buy those. However, considering that the noise cancellation in these Airpods is ALL driven by software, I have been extremely impressed with the results. It reduces the white noise of annoying sounds like public trains, airplanes, etc. very effectively. While voices and other louder sounds aren't cancelled completely, when music is playing through the earbuds these noises are quite enough to hardly notice. For me, that's enough. I don't need complete silence, I have my over-ear noise cancelling headphones for that.THE SOUND QUALITY:When I say that I was blown away the first time I listened to music on these Airpods, I was NOT kidding. The amount of bass that they managed to pack in to such small, open-eared earbuds is frankly impressive. The sound profile allows for an incredible listening experience no matter what genre of music you listen to (I listen to a wide range of pop, folk, indie, and rap primarily).THE OVERALL VERDICT:These Airpods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are exactly as I expected them to be. They fit extremely well, the ANC is very acceptable for what they are, and they sound amazing. That's not to mention the TINY case that they come in, making them so easy to slip anywhere. I have been looking for a solid pair of earbuds with ANC that work with my ears for the longest time now. I'm happy to say that these are everything I've ever wanted. If you have had issues with silicone ear-tip earbuds fitting you properly, then these are definitely worth a shot!","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024"

    Really nice headphones but not as comfortable as the old model","I've had a pair of AirPods 2 since 2019 and use them daily to listen to audiobooks while I am doing busy work around the house or to use my phone with VoiceOver as I am visually impaired and don't want to bother other people while my phone is reading everything to me.  I figured it was time to upgrade and try out the new AirPods 4 due to some of the new features I wanted.The biggest feature I wanted was a Find My speaker built in.  I had  lost the case ofr my current AirPods a few times and ended up attaching an AirTag to them inside an airtag case.  THis was bulky and made it awkward to keep them in my pocket.  Being able to play a sound without an extra accessory attached is huge.I also like the wireless charging and USB-C compatibility.  I have wireless chargers near my bed and on my desk where I work so I can pop them on anytime.  The internal magent also makes them stay in place kind of like an Apple Watch.The sound is really good.  An improvement over the previous ones but maybe a little more heavy on the low-end, so everything sounds a litle different with these.I like the spatial audio ability and hopefully will find a reason to use it soon.  I have some audiobooks that offer it, but I don't really care if the narrators voice changes with my head motion.  Hopefully I'll find some concerts or something that make it feel like I am in a concert hall or something.I am a little torn on the squeeze button on the stem.  I like being able to perform more actions than I could with a double tap of the old model, but if my hands are full or dirty, I can't just smack them with the back of my hand to activate the actions.  Being able to answer or decline calls or confirm Siri actions with a head shakle or nod is nice and maybe they will extend that to include customizeable head gestures so I can do things like play or pause music/books.The ANC and transparency modes are cool.  I usually leave them in transparency mode and only use ANC if I am doing something like vacuuming.The biggest issue I have with these is that they are not as comfortable as the AirPods 2.  Those I could put in my ear and quite literallyu forget they were there.  These are a little larger and go in deeper so if you do not place them precisely, they do cause a bit of discomfort.","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024"

    Great quality sound but didn't fit well to my ear","I really like its sound quality as it had a very deep bass and provided immersive sound experience. Noise cancellation is great and connectivity is so seamless that I really admire about it.  But main problem I had was with comfortability. Probably it was shape of my earlobe that it didn't fit as I wanted it to be. I often had experiences where it would fall out of my ear. Mostly while running on treadmill or while walking.

With that being said the cons compared to the pros 2 the noise cancellation doesn’t feel as good but it’s close enough to the pro 2 also some features on the pro 2s are missing from the gen 4.

Will check with Apple Store tomorrow.**AirPods 4 Review**1. **Sound** – I’m not expecting exceptional sound quality from AirPods. I choose them for the Apple ecosystem. The sound isn’t bad, but it doesn’t quite match competitors like the Bose Ultra. However, with Bose, you lose the seamless integration of the Apple ecosystem.2. **Noise Canceling (Compared to AirPods Pro 2)** – Most agree that the AirPods Pro 2 offer the best noise cancellation. However, I’ve noticed a persistent hissing sound with the AirPods Pro 2 that really bothers my ears. Surprisingly, I haven’t seen other users or reviewers mention this – they often just say their ears hurt after wearing them for a long time. I believe the hissing sound is the cause, which is one reason I prefer the AirPods 4 over the AirPods Pro 2. While the AirPods 4 have less effective active noise cancellation, the hissing issue is noticeably reduced.3. **Fit** – Some may dislike the looser fit of the AirPods 4, but I find it beneficial for long-term wear and overall ear health.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    Impressed by all the features","These AirPods 4 w/ ANC are nice. The sound quality is quite good.I caught a sale and decided to pull the trigger to replace my original AirPods that were getting long in the tooth.I thought the active noise cancellation would be a gimmick, but it’s quite nice and adaptive mode is pretty smart deciding when to turn it on. It’ll cancel out about 90% of the noise from the dryer and the stove exhaust fan.I was a little worried about ear fit since that can be touch and go with the style earbud that rests on the outside of the ear. It seems fine so far. I wouldn’t go jogging while wearing them, but I think they’ll stay in place for a light activity. The trick is to put them in with the stem facing down and then rotate them with the stem facing forward about 45°. That sort of secures them in place in the ear like a little key.I’m also happy with the case. The wireless charging is a nice addition. I can use my Apple Watch charger, a regular wireless charger, or USB-C.My original AirPods died at 13 months, just outside of warranty, and it was a big old pain to get them fixed. Given that experience, I went with the extended AppleCare plus coverage on these.

    Decent headphones","The good thing about these headphones are that they are a little more comfortable as they don't "plug" into the ears with silicone/rubber tips that most active noise canceling headphones do. They're comfortable and sit loosely on the ears. The noise canceling is decent when playing music. When music or audio is not being played, the noise from the environment is quite audible. The other downside for this is that the battery life is quite low. I think 6 hours should be the standard but the AirPods is ~4 hours. When I'm working and I'm in the zone with music, it barely gets me past half the day.Aside from that, I also own a pair of Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and those are in almost all ways better than these AirPods; sound quality, bluetooth distance, battery life, and noise canceling. For casual use and comfort, the AirPods may fare a tiny bit better but just a tiny bit.

For me this was important because I don’t like the pressure buildup and the silicone tips for long hours of wearing.  I like to keep these in not just for personal activities, but during the workday in the silicone tips start to bother me.2. Fit.

    Useful but buggy","It's hard to trash Airpods after having spent years using wired earbuds or early (failed) attempts at Bluetooth headphones.  Most of the time, Airpods work very well and have the least issues out of other similar products I've used.The 4th generation of Airpods do seem to have issues in contrast to the earlier versions.  Unlike other reviews, I don't have problems with them falling out.  I do find them to be unusually buggy, and increasingly so.  It seems to get worse the older the Airpods get.  They desync more frequently than older versions, the left one spontaneously disconnects and won't reconnect until putting it back in the case first (on a full charge), and sometimes there's this weird interference effect that causes crackling and can only be resolved by putting the Airpods back in their case and taking them back out again.I'll continue using these until I need to buy new ones, but I really have to wonder whether anyone at Apple actually tested this version for more than a few minutes.  And no, my issues aren't caused by the host device; these problems occur across different Apple devices and my Android phone.  There's no difference.  It's the Airpods that are the problem.","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025"

    The Right Choice","I knew it was time to upgrade from my cheap earbuds to something noise-canceling with a better battery life. I spent a lot of time comparing all of the different brands out there that offered noise canceling and a lot of the complaints were similar; they fell out easily and the quality was not what they expected. Some even mentioned that switching between devices was difficult and that was the ultimate decision-maker for me. I wanted to be able to switch between my phone, my iPad, and my laptop easily and these offered me that. So far I am really happy with them and the noise-canceling. I can vacuum with them and still hear what I'm listening to. I've only tried to answer one call with them and it came out scratchy so TBD on that front, will try again.","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

Super comfortable, they would stay in my ears forever, were effortless with iOS and sounded pretty darn good.But I was lured by the Pros, and they sounded great, but never fit my ears right, fell out a lot and hurt after a while.  Maybe the Pro 2 would be more comfortable.  Nah.But now the AirPods 4 with ANC are the bomb.  Just as comfortable as my lovable old originals, sound way better, though, and the ANC is surprisingly good.  You don't have a rubber thing shoved up your ear canal, so it's not as thorough as the Pro or Pro 2, but it is just fine!

There are no soft rubber caps. They are reasonably comfortable in my ear, but I would not trust them to stay in through any exercise. Apple does state this in the description, but I did not see it.-typical of Apple they changed the charging port for a USB-lightning to a USB-C but they do not give you a new charging cable.-also buyer should know that there are no manual volume controls on the AirPods themselves.

    Mostly good, annoying when it’s not.","For a purely in-ear ANC, it’s a wonder - even without silicone plugs, it just blocks noise. Long flights with these things on are a dream. Great battery life too, and Qi recharging is convenient.They’re a little weird to get out of the case, and you’ll drop them a few times getting used to it - push on the ear hole side to rotate the pod in its case before pulling it out and it’ll go more smoothly.The downsides - the conversation aware features aren’t configurable to make them *less* conversation aware. When you’re trapped on a bus with That Guy making a loud phone call, these will filter all the noise *but* Phone Boy, meaning his inane chatter will be focused and crystal clear, sort of the opposite of what you want. It’s otherwise great for personal conversations when your pods are in, but it’d be nice to have a ‘no, really, cancel everything’ setting.Otherwise like em just fine - a nice step up from the basic AirPods!","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

Can keep both ears in and talk and it will automatically lower the volume and switch to pass through so I can hear the person speaking to me better than I would without them in my ears at all. 5/5 stars for sure and worth the money if you are on the fence and have the same issue as I do with the pro 2s of staying in your ear","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"

 These Are a Good Option","I’ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.

But now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2—features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I’ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod’s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the “settings” app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.

The key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.

Of course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend “Pat Gray Unleashed!” if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the “Control Center” page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you’ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you’ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods.

I really like these things now that I’m a little more familiar with them. The quality and value are exquisite. If I discover more, I’ll edit this comment.

4 MONTHS LATER: Apple has improved the controls for these in their latest iOS update. The functions I had to dig around to find are now more easily accessed. Getting to the hearing test is now fairly straight forward.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

 Gold Standard Earbuds","I’ve had my AirPods Pro Gen 1 for a while, and they were absolutely amazing—until I accidentally sent them through the washer (oops!). I tried going the budget-friendly route and picked up a pair of SoundCore earbuds, but after a short time, I quickly remembered why AirPods are the standard. I returned the SoundCores and grabbed the Gen 2s, and I couldn’t be happier!

These earbuds are incredible. The setup is super user-friendly, and they fit perfectly thanks to the three different tip sizes, ensuring a snug, comfortable fit that stays in place even during workouts. The audio quality is top-notch—clear, rich sound that really stands out. The noise cancellation is a game-changer too; it’s so effective that I can block out the world, whether I’m at the gym, on a plane, or just trying to focus at home. The battery life is great. I use these buds daily and only need to charge them every other week or so. The design is sleek and clean and you can now control the volume using Siri or by sliding your fingers over the stem.

I use them daily for workouts, frequent phone calls, and even travel. I can’t recommend them enough. If you’re looking for premium, reliable earbuds that just work, the AirPods Pro Gen 2 are totally worth the investment. I love these things—hands down my favorite tech purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2025"

 READ BEFORE PURCHASE! 😊","First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!

I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.

The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.

The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.

I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.

As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It’s stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I’m heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it’s so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.

The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.

Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.

Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024"

 These are fantastic! First pair of AirPods. I use the hearing aid functionality","A couple months ago I got “commercial” hearing aids from the VA. However, I didn’t like how they operated so I gave them back, and they’re going to order a different brand/model, which I’ll have in about three months (!) So I went in search of quality, inexpensive hearing aids to fill the gap. (My hearing loss is considered mild, at -32db on one side and -39db on the other.) I got the AirPods last Friday, and the software for hearing aid support rolled out last night (iOS 18.1) So this will be a two part review.

Part one is the overall operation as earbuds for music and calls. These are my first ever Apple branded sound devices. Once I got the correct tips installed and the buds fitted, I was ready to go. OMG! The sound quality overall is the best of any earbuds I’ve ever owned, and by a huge margin. Astonishing bass, and crisp high range. (My hearing loss is in the upper ranges.) I’m beyond happy. Overall, the only thing I’m dissatisfied with is the battery life at 5-6 hours, but the extremely fast recharge speed eases that compliant. Voice quality when on a call is crystal clear. Controls are easy, though a bit hard to operate considering how small they are.

Part two is the hearing aid function. The first thing I had to do was take a hearing test with the included software. (However, if you prefer to use a third party hearing test, you can import that profile and use it.) The hearing test takes about 5 minutes, after which the hearing aid sound enhancement profile is set automatically and they start up. I was totally gobsmacked at how well these things work! They boost the exact freqs I need. They actually work considerably better than those $7000 (egads!) hearing aids that I returned.

Now for the ANC. At home, I sit right in front of a large, noisy window air conditioner. On the opposite side of the room is a dehumidifier (I live in south central Texas, where it was 91° yesterday.) Between these two pieces of equipment, it’s pretty noisy here. I turned on ANC and the room went absolutely silent. So silent that I thought I’d popped a circuit breaker and everything had stopped running. I removed one of the AirPods, and the noise returned. Amazing.

In short, everything I’d hoped the commercial hearing aids would do, the AirPods actually DID. I consider this the smartest purchase I’ve made in years. Only one negative, and that’s the ear tips. None of the provided sizes are a good fit for me, so I’m now looking to memory foam replacements. But that’s a very small gripe. If you’re looking at these, either for music or hearing, don’t hesitate. You’ll be glad you got them.

EDIT: I had to go to a doctor appointment across town today. Part of the route is on a toll highway with an 80 mph speed limit and heavy traffic. I got up to speed and turned on noise cancel mode. INSTANTLY the car was completely silent at 80 mph. No road rumble, no engine noise, no wind noise, no traffic noise. It was an amazing and invigorating experience. Oh, for those wondering about recharge time, if you take them all the way down to 0% battery and they shut down (I’ve now ascertained that 6 hours is about what you get with all the options turned on), it only takes about 15 minutes in the charge case and you’ll easily get another 3-4 hours out of them.

EDIT2: Okay, I’ve had these for almost a month, and I just keep liking them more and more. I didn’t mention pairing in my original text above, so I need to mention it here. There is, in effect, no pairing that you need to do, at least in the Apple-verse. By the time I’d opened the charging case and looked at the buds, they’d already paired with both my iPhone and iPad. I didn’t have to go into settings on my iOS devices, or press any buttons on the case. Just open case and it’s done. As a computer engineer for 40 years, I have never seen a faster or more seamless pairing of anything.

One more word on recharging: just today I took them all the way to zero. Dropped them in the charger and in FIVE MINUTES they were at 24%.

I am in love with the hearing aid functionality. I hear sounds in movies that I’d never heard before in my life, even when my hearing was perfect. And I can adjust amplification either by going into settings on my iPhone, or sliding my finger up or down on the stem.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024"

 Very Versatile, Handy and Functional Tech","These Airpods are one of the best purchases I've made in a long time. I wish I had done my research on them sooner. I especially purchased these over cheap earphones because of the Apple hearing aid features. My hearing is pretty bad and these have helped me in several occasions and are very functional. Even if you are not using the hearing aid features (there are a few), the noise cancellation on these is amazing. You can opt to have them adjust to whatever your needs are. All of the settings can be a bit confusing so you do have to play with them a bit to find the adjustments that work for you. However, even this may change depending on what you need them for. Sometimes you need to cancel noise, or listen to music but need to hear other urgent sounds around you, or you may just need them to talk on the phone. I have used these quite a bit over the last 5 months and they have been very reliable. I never have connection issues with my phone or microphone issues.
I like that Apple does updates on these, just like their other products. I am amazed at this technology especially for its tiny size and I wish I had gotten these a lot sooner.","Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2025"

 Cheap Alternative to Casual Heaaring Problems","In 2023 I got tested by an audiologist and was diagnosed with mild to moderate hearing loss, and offered hearing aids for $3,000. I then started doing research on OTC hearing aids which became available in late 2023. The reviews revealed a wide range of personal reviews of usage with both quality and price. Being retired and rarely in social environments my hearing problems were at home with my spouse on daily basis, and family occasionally. I really didn't want to commit thousands for aids I would not use while awake .All the reviews had problems with even the best rated aids. When IOS 18.1 was announced with the hearing aid option I considered buying the Airpods, since my old Earbuds were defunct. I bought a pair, took the fit and hearing test, which confirmed my mild and moderate hearing loss. Reviews of the Airpods, had two cons, the stigma of wearing in public while conversing and 5-6 hours of use before recharging. The first week I wore them in public and didn't detect any bad feedback. They are everything they claim to be. Control with iPhone app is easy to use and the four modes of hearing optiions, Off, Transparency, Adaptive, and Noise Cancellation work as expected. The first day I heard things in my house I haven't heard in 20 years! I can now hear my wifes tiny voice, even from another room. I don't need them for TV, so I rarely have them on for more than six hours. Put in the charging case, they recharge to 100% in less than hour. I have only two cons; they can fall out, even if you pass the fit test, and one of the pods chirps occasionally while inserted. For someone who needs excellent hearing assistance in a casual or intermittent setting and doesn't want to spend hundreds or thousands, I highly recommend these. Plus, Apple will probably add improvements in the future.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

 solid","Here is my take

Apple AirPods have become synonymous with wireless earbuds, and for good reason. Their seamless integration with Apple devices is truly unmatched. Pairing is a breeze, and the audio switching between devices like iPhones, iPads, and Macs is incredibly smooth. The sound quality is decent for everyday listening, with a focus on clarity and a balanced sound profile.

Pros:

Seamless Apple Ecosystem Integration: This is the biggest selling point. Pairing is effortless, and switching between devices is incredibly smooth.
Comfortable Fit: The AirPods generally fit comfortably for most people.
Intuitive Controls: The tap controls are easy to learn and use.
Good Call Quality: The built-in microphones offer decent call quality.
Stylish and Discreet: The AirPods have a minimalist and stylish design.
Cons:

Price: The AirPods are significantly more expensive than many comparable earbuds from other brands.
Sound Quality: While decent, the sound quality isn't exceptional. Bass can be lacking, and the soundstage can feel somewhat limited.
Limited Customization: Customization options for sound are limited compared to some competitors.
Durability: Some users have reported durability issues, particularly with the stems.
Fit Issues: Not everyone finds the AirPods comfortable, and they may fall out for some.
Overall:

The Apple AirPods are a premium product with a premium price tag. If you're deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem and prioritize seamless integration and ease of use, the AirPods are an excellent choice. However, if sound quality is your top priority or you're on a budget, there are more affordable and potentially better-sounding options available.

Recommendation:

Highly recommended for: Apple users who prioritize seamless integration and ease of use within the Apple ecosystem.
Consider alternatives if: Sound quality is your top priority, you're on a budget, or you're concerned about durability.

 Fantastic headphones for users of apple products","I love and own many apple devices and bought the AirPods Pro specifically because of integration with my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro and Apple TV. The integration is really nice - the devices paired seamlessly when I purchased the headphones and it has been trivial to switch from one device to another. The headphones are beautifully designed and look and feel like a premium product, as you'd expect from Apple. They sound really good when listening to music and television, and call quality when paired to an iPhone is fantastic. I assume that the microphone quality is good as I've used these headphones for many work calls and am yet to receive any negative feedback. Sound cancellation is also fantastic.

The AirPods hold a good charge and I recently used them without issue for 4 hours straight on a transatlantic flight. Charging them is as simple as popping them into their case and the case itself can be charged via USB-C or, as I prefer, via MagSafe. I didn't like the look of these headphones when they first came out but guess I've become acclimatized seeing people wear them daily and no longer have any issue.

There are two issues that may impact one's opinion of this product. Firstly, I've heard complaints from multiple people that none of the buds that come with the device fit comfortably in their ears. I did not encounter this issue myself but my wife, who also purchased the headset, and the wife of a friend both felt discomfort when using the AirPods. Perhaps smaller ears are an issue?

Secondly, the AirPods can only be paired with another device via the case. Most of the time this isn't a problem but I we are my AirPods to the gym and don't normally bring my case. Most treadmills, ellipticals, etc. in shared settings retain devices (and other information) only for that session and I find that every time I want to use gym equipment I need to repair - meaning that I have to have the case with me. Ideally I'd be able to hold down a button on one of the AirPods and pair that way. This certainly isn't a dealbreaker for me, and likely won't be for most people, but it's a minor annoyance that detracts a little from an otherwise stellar product.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025"

Design & Comfort

Apple sticks with its minimalist white design, but the AirPods Pro 2 are slightly tweaked for better ergonomics and stability. The four included ear tip sizes (XS, S, M, L) allow for a more customized fit, making them comfortable for extended wear.

The MagSafe charging case now has a built-in speaker for better Find My alerts, a lanyard loop, and USB-C charging (for the latest version).

Sound Quality

The AirPods Pro 2 deliver crisp highs, balanced mids, and deeper bass compared to the first-gen model. The H2 chip enhances audio processing, making sound richer and more immersive.

Key Features:
• Adaptive EQ fine-tunes music in real time.
• Personalized Spatial Audio creates a theater-like 360° experience.
• Bass is punchier without overpowering vocals.

While the sound is fantastic, audiophiles may miss high-resolution codec support like aptX or LDAC.

Active Noise Cancellation & Transparency Mode
• ANC is 2x better than the original AirPods Pro, making them among the best noise-canceling earbuds.
• Adaptive Transparency Mode intelligently reduces sudden loud noises while keeping voices and ambient sound clear.

Whether you’re in a busy city, on a plane, or at the gym, the AirPods Pro 2 handle noise exceptionally well.

Battery Life & Charging
• Up to 6 hours of listening time with ANC on (vs. 4.5 hours in the original AirPods Pro).
• Up to 30 hours total with the MagSafe charging case.
• USB-C, MagSafe, and Apple Watch charger compatibility (for the newest model).

Battery life is solid, but some competitors like the Sony WF-1000XM5 offer longer playtime.

Connectivity & Features
• Seamless Apple ecosystem integration (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch).
• Bluetooth 5.3 for better stability and efficiency.
• Audio Sharing lets you connect two pairs of AirPods to one device.
• Siri voice control for hands-free use.

Android users can use them, but they’ll miss features like auto-switching, spatial audio, and Find My tracking.

Final Verdict

The AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) are an outstanding choice for Apple users looking for top-tier noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and seamless integration with their devices. While pricey, they deliver a premium audio experience with strong ANC, spatial audio, and deep Apple ecosystem connectivity.

⭐ Rating: 9/10 ⭐

Best For:
✅ Apple users who want the best wireless earbuds for iPhones
✅ Commuters and travelers needing top-tier noise cancellation
✅ Those who love Spatial Audio for immersive sound

Consider Alternatives If:
❌ You need hi-res audio support (Sony WF-1000XM5, Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II)
❌ You’re an Android user (Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro may be better)
❌ You want a cheaper pair of noise-canceling earbuds","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2025"

 Big Improvement over 1st Gen, not so sure they are hearing aids","I was fairly satisfied with my first generation AirPods Pro, having bought them several years ago mostly for use when working out. When Apple announced the addition of hearing aids features, I thought it was a good excuse to upgrade. And it would be one less lightning connector I'd have to contend with. This review is written for those of you who are considering upgrading.

I bought these prior to the release of iOS 18.1. The setup was the same as before, find comfortable rubbers, run the test that plays the little tune and that's it. With iOS 18.0 the sound didn't seem much better over Gen 1 AirPods Pro, but the noise cancellation was an improvement. However, with the update to 18.1 there's a big change. There's now a hearing assistance screen where you toggle on hearing aids. You're prompted to take a hearing test. This test is similar to hearing tests you might have had in school or at a doctors' office where tones of differing pitch and loudness are played and you tap a button on the screen when you hear it. It takes about 10 minutes or so. The phone/earbuds then produce a profile based on your test results. You can also take the report to an audiologist (the report is in the Health app), although I'm not all that sure they'd bother to review it.

Once you've done a hearing test the hearing aid is enabled. You can then make adjustments to the default settings. I found the default setting to have far too much high end for my liking and too much gain as well. But then again maybe I'm just used to being half-deaf. 😉 I did discover I have a device with a bad fan though, so maybe that's a good thing. I don't seem to get any squealing or feedback when using the hearing aid feature but I've only used it a few times. It did come in handy when at a meeting with a quiet talker speaking, boosting up the sound made it much easier to listen. But ultimately I'd say the hearing aid function is a gimmick. If you're really worried about hearing loss, go to an audiologist.

However, there is one thing that going through the hearing test and setting up hearing assistance does improve and that's the playback of music. Because it is able to adjust EQ to match your hearing profile there's a drastic improvement in how good the AirPods sound. I'd put them on par with my Bose QC-3 headset now, maybe even slightly better (Bose still has much better noise cancellation of course). Adaptive noise cancellation works but tends to be little too aggressive, so I just use full cancellation. The personalized volume and conversation awareness functions are also a little too touchy and seem to be constantly changing the volume control in response to false alarms. I'm sure they'll get better over time but for now I wouldn't say they're a reason to switch.

They also have the same problems connecting to whatever random device happens to grab them. I work out with my Watch but leave my phone at home. So if I start playing a podcast or music in my driveway it will originate from my iPhone, even if I'm using my watch to initiate the media. It is getting slightly better in that eventually the AirPods will abandon the iPhone then connect to the Watch (I used to have to pull them out of my ears, wait a few seconds then try to start playback on the watch), but there's still a gap of a few annoying seconds while they sort things out. Again, not the end of the world, but seems like a solvable problem.

If you're hoping to get budget hearing aids, look elsewhere. I can't imagine wearing these for 12-16 hours a day. I'm not so sure the batteries will last that long anyway. Besides, you're wearing earbuds, so people probably won't realize you're using them in hearing aid mode. And let's all admit it, they look kind of dorky.","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024"

    Unbelievably helpful for mild hearing loss","I had my hearing checked a few years ago by COSTCO and it revealed that I had mild hearing loss. It was a toss up as to whether I might need hearing aids but I felt my hearing was adequate at this stage of my life. I was retired and not doing a lot of socializing. Just recently I had a hearing test done by Miracle Ear. After my test they strongly recommended that I get their hearing aids and could even try them out before I purchased them. The options were a good, better, best solution which was confusing as to their value. Also charging them and maintaining them seemed like they would be more trouble than they were worth. BTW they were very expensive even with the huge price discount offered so I declined. Once again I felt my hearing was adequate for my present retirement. During the morning of the President’s day sale I ordered some Apple air pod pro 2’s. Amazon delivered them that day. I took the hearing test that revealed I had “mild” hearing loss in both of my ears.  I then turned on the hearing aid function and voila what a difference. Could now hear my wife when she was in every room of our home. No longer needed closed caption on the tv and XM radio never sounded better. So for my mild hearing loss the air pod pro 2’s are incredible. Now to try and get my wife to buy a pair for herself.  Ha! Ha!","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025"

    Pretty amazing.","I bought a pair of these for my Mom, for Christmas, after having seen the advertisement which showcased their hearing aid feature.I really was curious as to how well they would work, but I had a feeling that being an Apple product, they would work fairly well.My Mom isn't very tech savvy, and doesn't care to attempt to learn, but I think these earbuds will help encourage her, especially since it seems they are quickly becoming her new "ears" and just two days after Christmas, she was so used to them being in her ears, she wore the batteries out and didn't realize.I should note, as with any foreign object in, on, or around your ears can be an annoyance, and can take some time to get used to.Enough bloviating. I got these and set them up. I did find the process a bit confusing, but it eventually got figured out by this crayon-eating Marine.I had to walk my Mom through the hearing test, which is offered by Apple, on her iPhone. We found she had significant hearing loss in her left ear, and moderate in her right ear, and I noticed the difference while using the earbuds to finish setting up.Once I had setup finished and gave Mom back the earbuds, I noticed a significant difference between these Apple earbuds and the $1,500.00 hearing aids she bought and has complained about for the past several years.Yes, these work considerably better than some of the expensive, dedicated hearing aid brands. I am shocked.While using the expensive hearing aids, I still have to speak up for her to hear me. With these, she can hear me whisper from halfway across the room!As of now, I can't speak much for the durability because she's had them for two days, but I highly advise a lanyard/tether because earbuds do fall out and are easy to lose, and they can be difficult for a Senior to fit properly into their ears, especially if they arent uses to them.Pros:Relatively inexpensiveComfortableLight weightThe hearing aid feature works amazingly wellCons:Easy to lose (get a lanyard)Can be difficult for a Senior person to adjust toCould charge a little more quickly.I very highly recommend these for anyone looking for a lower cost alternative to proper hearing aids that very possibly may not work as well as these, and at a fraction of the price, it is a little easier to have a couple of sets to last the day as the battery life is roughly five to six hours.","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2024"

    Great, but…","I use these primarily for noise cancellation features, as I have misophonia and hate hearing trigger sounds.Initially, I was going to return these because the sound cancellation let sound in, unlike my 1st gens!UNTIL— I noticed, due to the design of the ear tips themselves, they allow more sound in compared to the AirPod Pro 1st Gen.At first glance, both tips look the same. But they are not! The 1st Gen are more “circular”, and the 2nd is more “oval” or condensed like a “pill” shape. My ear hole is a circle, not a pill shape, lol, so it didn’t seal all the way.I tested that theory by placing my 1st Gen ear tips on the 2nd Gen. Viola! They’re much better than the 1st ones now, and I no longer want to return them!Also—I don’t hear my pulse/heartbeat in my ears with these ones like I did with the 1st Gen, which is a major upgrade because I HATE the sound of a heartbeat. Just pure, almost blissful silence. Unfortunately… these do not turn off the ringing in ears, hah.Also—the “background sound” feature (which is like a sound machine built into iPhones) via accessibility setting on the iPhone are amazing through these airpods.Long story short, these are amazing for misophoniacs.","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

They were simple to pair to my iPhone 16 and had a 60% charge right out of the box. The sound quality is excellent. I hear detail with these that I miss with more expensive Bose & Sennheiser HP's. They are comfortable and have a test mode for best fit. It will recommend the best size cups (they come with 5 total sizes). They have a hearing test mode and I was surprised that even at my age (I'm a senior) it said my hearing is normal. It shows you a plot of your hearing for anyone who want to know the details. If your hearing tests deficient they provide some form of hearing aid assist but it's only available if your hearing fails the test. In addition to the ANC (which is very good) they have a Transparency mode that allows you to hear sounds around you without sacrificing quality. I'm very happy with this purchase and will get a lot of use from these. I haven't tried them yet with my Mac Mini or on phone calls but I'm sure they'll work great. One thing to note: to get the new features (hearing test etc) you must have IOS version 18 or higher.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

    If you are on the fence, take the leap, trust me.","I always talked bad about wireless earbuds but wow these are incredible. The sound quality is awesome, the noise canceling is akin to turning off everything around you, if it's super noisy around you high peaks like claps and snaps might leak through but it's hardly noticeable when there is music playing. The controls are easy to use, responsive and work surprisingly well. Not sure how the experience compares on non ios devices, however with the brief playing around with it, the extra capabilities with ios are incredible, the background sounds feature is awesome for reading/relaxing you don't get distracted by outside noise due to noise cancelation and the stock noise options are very calming and let you focus well (I prefer this to using them with no noise as the cancelation is so good the clicking of your teeth and breathing are very noticeable). The remote listening is sneaky and I will be playing more with it, I have a 15 pro max so the mic is very good so I can whisper across the room from my phone with 2 fans on and hear myself clear as day, but experience may be different with older models with less adept microphones. The hearing aid mode is also awesome and with no experience with traditional hearing aids myself I can't compare but for mild/moderate hearing loss I would say these would be perfectly acceptable. Overall I am shocked at how great these are, it's rare to buy something and be blown out of the water with the quality. If I lost these things I would buy another in a heartbeat(unlikely as they have airtag built in lol) 10/10 buy these now you will not be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    AirPod Pro 2","Airpod pro 2So I have moderate to severe loss in my two years. Their doctor said maybe I wouldn’t even wanna get a hearing aid for the one year because it wasn’t going to help much but I do hear on that ear much better with the earbuds.So I found my hearing aid setting on my Ibuds. I can hear the guy opening soda cans and he’s about 15 feet away from me.So my wife is kind of soft spoken, and even if her head is not facing me and she starts talking to me, I can hear her.So I’ve been hearing this rattling noise in the car and I realize after four days that it was a turn signal that I can hear now with my earbuds. Now the hearing aid works while I’m listening to talk radio or music at the same time. I was thinking maybe the clicking sound was coming from talk radio.So I listened to talk radio for about 5 1/2 hours the other day with them before the battery went deadBut it came with this carrying case that is a little bit smaller than a dental floss case and it charges my earbuds quick.I have my phone set up where if I tilt my head up and down it answers and if I go side to side, it hangs up the phone call.The right air kept falling out, and I downsize the little rubber boot down two sizes.The right air kept falling out, and I downsize the little rubber boot down two sizes","Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2025"

    How well the hearing aid works","I purchased this product specifically for the hearing aid functionality. I had 3 other hearing aids, all OTC but they did have voice enhancements, not just amplifiers. Each broke for different reasons but the enhance sounds were all the same, very noisy. With the ability to do hearing tests on each ear, then have them calibrated to exactly what is needed to be corrected is far above any OTC hearing aid. It is so quiet, there is no hiss or bussing, no sometimes extra feedback, just improved hearing. Also being able to control the ambient sound is wonderful. Also I found they sat within in my ear with no problem with falling out, which I was worried about. The sound when listening to music is very nice. Also the way it fits in with giving you messages and being able to be controlled with your voice is very useful. If you have small to medium hearing loss I highly recommend getting them just for that function alone, truth is they have many great features but the hearing aid was most important to me.","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2025"

    They're great, but buy the Apple Care policy!","I don't remember if I submitted this review, but just in case, I want to correct it.I was wrong. There is NO crack. What I thought was a crack was a seam! So let me repeat, I love these! They are so good that I just bought a pair for my husband, and on those I could see that it wasn't a crack, but a seam!!! So buy, and enjoy!I love these, but after 2 months of use, the right one sounded softer. It turns out that there's a crack in it. I have been extremely careful, so I don't know how it could have happened. I almost wonder if there was a crack to begin with that just spread to the point where I could see it. I am past the return deadline. I don't know what to do.My suggestion is that if you purchase these airpods (which are wonderful,) spring for the Applecare policy. I got it when I bought a pair for my husband last week. I wish I had it for myself, now.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

    Apple is Apple","Exceeds all expectations. I was the Airpods 3 user till now and simply forgot my airpods at home while we embarked on a 3 week trip to US. Have been debating which model to take Airpods 4 or the Pro, mostly because the Pros have the silicone tips and I never was able to wear such earphones for longer than 30 minutes without having ear pains and heaviness in the head so Airpods 2,3 or 4 were always the preferred form factor for me. But I decided to give it a try, and OH MY GOD - these are the most comfortable earphones I have ever worn... I didnt even change the medium sized tips which were mounted on the airpods pro when they arrived. I will not go into all the amazing features - there is enough written and reviewed about them out there - I just want to say - bloody amazing!The fit and the comfort is superb - I constantly catch myself still wearing them even after I am done with the phonecall - simply forget they are there - and the conversation awareness and transparency help in this cause you can hear people you talk to perfectly...Very much recommend","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025"

    Great Sound & Noise Cancellation","I got these to use on long drives and at work because they are discreet, especially if you have long hair like me. I worked in a factory that had a “ let me see it” and “ we won't ask if you have them” policy with earbuds. So many of the guys wore hoodies, beanies, or just grew long hair. I paired them with my Android and was so impressed with the noise cancellation that I bought an iPhone to unlock more features. I could use one at a time during my long 12-hour shifts or use both with the passthrough on so I could hear the people around me. The quick charge time when in the case made the 30-minute breaks all I needed during the day to keep them working. I do recommend a slim case of some sort to keep them closed if you are clumsy because the small size makes them hard to find if you drop the entire thing and they get lost in a loud environment. The water resistance makes them safe to use in hot weather or workouts. I upgraded to the USB-C case to avoid using multiple cables, but it wasn’t a must since there isn’t any difference in the buds themselves. I recommend them if you have an iPhone and if you have an Android only if you want some small but functional earbuds that are less bulky than the competitors.","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025"

    very good","Just got this 3 days ago.  at 65, I had a little hard time setting it up, but with a help of Verizon personnel, I was able to make it work.  It's pretty good.  I tests your hearing first, and adjust the volume accordingly.  If you want to change the volume, you can do that too.  The volume it gave me is perfect.  The sound quality is pretty close to the naked ear sound.  It switch to earphone when you're  using Youtube or phone, but once you're done with them, it goes back to hearing aid.  Since the volume is just right, I'm comfortable and it picks up the sound/voice well.  I haven't really tested noise reduction though.I bout a strap for the pods, so I won't lose it.  They stay in my ears just fine, but just in case.  Over all I am happy with this product.","Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025"

    All the positive reviews under these airpods are true!","My Fello college students, if you want a short explanation of what to expect, here's what I'd say.The noise cancelling is amazing, it's so advanced to the point that you may get a dizzy sensation the first time you put them in. But you'll get use to it.The music audio is a 10/10. Everything is crisp and fluent.If it doesn't fit you can put in a smaller/bigger earpiece size in (they send you a S/M/L/XL). They each clip onto the airpods through magnetic connection. If you're really sweaty or have a lot of jell in your ear, the airpods may tend to slip out a little bit, but that's an easy fix. Either just wipe your ear down or wipe the airpod off.I personally LOVE bass. These air pods provide a good kick. The mix of advanced noise cancellation + sound quality makes the bass sound super nice. So if you're looking for quality bass sound I'd recommend these air pods, however, if you're looking for bass that will quite literally blast your eardrums out of their sockets, I'd recommend you go checkout Skullcandy headphones.They also have manual features that you can use to change/skip/replay songs.Overall, I'd give these airpod's a 9.5/10 with the only negative being the fact that it may fall out sometimes due to sweat. (But lets be honest, no airpod is going to completely withstand a low ammount of friction due to a liquid without having some other sort of earpiece to keep it in place). Therefore, these are a 10/10!","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Earbuds Pro and their Dozens of Features","I had always said I would not use a hearing aid until it came with the controls I think necessary. No hearing aid did. I read the early reviews coming in, and realized my 'bluff had been called'. Got the Earbuds Pro on sale here for $150 Thanksgiving sale, and a couple weeks later with the aid of kids did all of the installation.They are complicated to use, son suspects it is a matter of the dozens of features they have and that they automatically implement - often times inconveniently. I like all of the features and use most of them at one time or another.  If some feature quits working in the middle of a conversation or the such, the easiest solution for me is to take one bud out. Don't know why that works, but it does. I do need to learn to do it inconspicuously.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

    Bought for hearing aid feature","I’ve owned (and lost) an older set of Air Pods Pro but when the hearing aid feature was announced,  I knew I wanted to at least try them again.I don’t really care for in-ear headphones but I started wearing clinical hearing aids (Jabra Enhance Select 300 $~1500) and while to help and work pretty well, there are a couple things I don’t care for.  1) being inserted into your ear canal, they start to annoy me after a few hours.  2) when in a noisy environment (restaurant, lunch room etc) it is almost worse wearing them.The Air Pods Pro v2 are perfect but have some things that really set them apart.  1) they don’t bother me as much as as the Jabra or at least in the same way.  That’s largely personal preference I’m sure.  2) the background noise setting and conversation enhance are amazing.  Still some room for improvement but when I’m in an overly noisy environment, I would take my Jabra out because it was overwhelming and they were making it worse, not better.  I actually put my Air Pods Pro in when in that same environment.  I can actually hear people across from me.The one other thing that will take some time is that wearing the Air Pods Pro in public or at work looks like you aren’t paying attention.  People don’t even notice when I’m wearing my Jabra.The battery life on the Air Pods Pro is no wear as long as the Jabra but that’s fine for the cost.At the end of the day they are well worth the $200 I paid (on sale) and I expect Apple will continue to improve these over time.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025"

    sounds amazing","The sound of these airpods are great - definite four stars.  Love the sound cancellation feature and this feature works well with audio playing.  My daughter has the lightning version of Airpro Pro 2 and had her use the sound cancellation to cutdown on live music she's attended with me.The sound separation is great, depending on what I am listening to I either use the dsp for 3d sound or just straight stereo.  The soundstage almost rivals my audeze isine's and EL-8 which is saying something.The only complaint I have is finding the right cushion for the perfect fit when moving (minus 1/2 star if that was possible), but I have not tried 3rd party cushions yet, just the four sizes provided by apple.I have yet to try it mowing, leaf blowing or snow blowing - too afraid of one falling out due to perfect fit issue.  I know the find me feature works well since we had to use it on more than one occassion to find my daughters...I am looking forward to trying the hearing aid capability since in a loud restaurant or bar it is hard for me to pick up conversation from across a large table with a lot of conversation going on...","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Apple AirPods Pro 2 – A Game-Changing Audio Experience","The Apple AirPods Pro 2 are nothing short of exceptional, offering a seamless blend of cutting-edge technology and unparalleled user experience. As a frequent user of wireless earbuds, I am genuinely impressed by the enhancements Apple has introduced in this iteration.Sound Quality & Active Noise CancellationThe sound quality is superb, delivering rich bass, crisp mids, and clear highs. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) has been noticeably improved from the previous generation. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments like public transport or bustling cafes.

It’s another example of Apple’s commitment to accessibility.Comfort & DesignThe design remains sleek and minimalistic, but the addition of extra silicone tip sizes ensures a snug and comfortable fit for prolonged use. The lightweight build means you can wear them for hours without discomfort, whether you’re working, exercising, or relaxing.Seamless ConnectivityApple’s proprietary H2 chip ensures a smooth and instantaneous connection to all Apple devices.

    You must buy these their perfect","I’ve had these AirPods for almost 2 years and let me say that they are the best purchase you will ever make. I’ve never written a review but I had to because of how magnificent these are. The noice cancelling is amazing, for my first test I sat in a chair playing loud music turned away from a piano. I sat and waited, then took one out to tell her to start playing. To my astonishment she had been playing for a while and I didn’t even notice. The transparency mode is amazing as well because you’ll often forget there even in your ears because it plays the sound so well. You can even hear the slightest brush of your fingers it’s like there not even in. They are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly in your ears. They hardly weigh anything but they still have amazing battery life. They are extremely durable and water resistant as well. I had one in my pocket and as I went to get the mail it fell out. An hour later after searching and searching I found it in the road in the snow with tire tracks right over it practically burying it. It took it home thinking it would be completely ruined, but besides worse noice cancelling and a big scratch on the side (which is only cosmetic damage) it works perfectly. And don’t even get me started on the audio quality. I have high quality head phones and these AirPods Pro 2 blow them out of the water and they are extremely portable. The precision find my is also so nice because it also doubles as an AirTag. I put them on my keys and haven’t lost them since. Seriously the best product I’ve ever purchased because I use them hours daily. The only possible downside I could even think of is if you have very large ears, they may not fit great since the tips only go to extra large. Also don’t buy apple care plus. It’s a scam because they are literally indestructible and impossible to lose. Best $250 dollars ever spent would give 10 stars if possible. Seriously besides my phone, which I use to connect with my AirPods, there is nothing I use more than these AirPod pros. Also I exercise in them all the time and unless intentionally trying to knock them out, they’ve never fallen out. Oh yeah and also they are perfect for taking calls as well. And they fit perfectly into the overpriced apple ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

I love the touch control, I wondered why they had me actually pinch to control, then I remembered my old cheap earbuds that would turn on and off, volume up to ear bleeding volume when water would touch them, these don’t do that! They’re durably and have survived my use!

    Highly-Customizable Audio","I was skeptical about these Airpod Pro 2's being an upgrade from the previous version, but I'm happy I ignored my doubts and purchased them during Black Friday for a screamin' deal on a worthy updated bit of hardware.The combination of these Airpods and iOS 18 with my iPhone 15 is great! I wanted to utilize the features for the hearing impaired to share with my husband who struggles to hear me (perhaps sometimes that's his intent...).  While his hearing loss is significant - approximately 80% in both ears - these do help some.  While not a replacement for hearing aids for significant hearing loss, a great option for those with mild loss.I think what I was most impressed by when I first tried these Airpods was their noise-canceling ability. Followed quickly by their transparency mode. Both are equally good and useful.The sound quality is outstanding. I was hearing things in all kinds of music genres (Pop, Rock, Country, Classical) that I had previously missed. There's a depth of sound with nuances that were pleasantly unexpected.Charging is simple via USB-C cable or wireless charging, and effective, with the Airpods lasting on one charge based upon what you're using them for and features enabled. Listening to music, about 5 1/2 hours, but if you add spacial audio to the mix, about 4 1/2 hours. With up to 6 charges of the Airpods per full charge on the case.(Per Google) Here are some other things to know about the AirPods Pro 2 battery life:- A five-minute charge gives you about an hour of battery life- Real-world results may differ from the estimates, which are based on a 50% volume level- To recharge the case, you can put your AirPods back in the case when you're not using them- If you only listen to your AirPods for a few hours a day, you can charge the case every 2 to 3 daysI own Bose and Bowers & Wilkins over-ear phones, which both offer excellent audio quality, but these are by far my favorite. I had previously avoided the AirPods as the fit in my ears was not good, but these Pro 2's fit well and in addition to using them at my desk, I could see using them during workouts without issue.Definitely worth your consideration.","Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2024"

All automate! It took a lot of fiddling with all the options to get the earbuds adjusted to just the way I want them to perform, but it was also fun playing with all the options.

    Recommend","For the most part, the Airpod Pro earbuds do a decent job of staying in (versus the last two iterations that wouldn't stay in if I happened to look in any direction other than forward). But, there was still that feeling and doubt that made me worry that they may fall out for whatever reason.After looking for weeks to find something that would work (including some that apparently caused some of the functionality of the earbuds to not work because it covered it up), these popped up. I was hesitant b/c it seemed so new and there were so few reviews, but in the end, figured if it worked, great! If not, then that would be reflected in this review. Ultimately, I'm happy to report that they work exactly like they should, minus a single flaw that can be overlooked, if you're willing to deal with the slight inconvenience.The package arrived (thank you, Prime!) quickly, and the box looks like any box that would contain these sorts of things. I don't know, there's nothing special to report there. What's nice is that they include 3 pairs (all the same size) that fit very snugly over each earbud, and each cover does NOT...cover...the little black, whatever-they-are-they-look-like-vents.Airpod functionality is not affected as they still pause when you take them out of your ears. The stems are obviously not affected, and once they're in your ears, they do a good job of holding the Airpod in place (despite some extremely vigorous headshaking)I have only two requests for future versions of these:1. Make different size "wing" tips. Mine fit ok, and the tip doesn't push too hard into the ear; just enough to hold the earbud in place.2. The case doesn't close when you put the earbuds into the charging case.#1 would just be nice. As far as #2 is concerned, however, that cannot be helped. The Airpod Pros are not designed to have any add-ons as they would interfere with the case closing. I tried giving it a squeeze to close the case (very gently), but no dice. You'll just have to pop them off, but they come off so quickly and easily that it shouldn't be a problem. I'd recommend getting a case for your Airpod Pros (yes, a case for the case), and store the additional earbud tips that way.Overall, I'm very satisfied with these. I've paired these with some memory foam tips to get a better seal as well. Not necessary, but it helps. Anyway, great purchase and great item!TL;DRPros- Does not interfere with primary functionality- Keeps each earbud very secure in the ear (YMMV)- Easy to pop on and off each earbud- Comes in three pairs in case you lose any of themCons- Can't close the case with them on- Tips are only one size","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024"

    These are fantastic ear buds","Well first off, I have been an AirPod guy for a while.I have also been a cheap AirPod guy too, meaning I have always bought the basic ones and been pretty happy with them, for the most part. I’m a carpenter and so things get treated a bit rough with me but I have always longed for something a bit better, meaning better quality sound, maybe some noise cancelation and just a better ear bud all around. I really wanted to have that precision “find me app” quality that AirTags have but the older more basic air pods don’t have it. They claimed to but not once did they play a sound and not once could I find them with the find my app, these have the precision locating and also play a loud tone .. but also (see below)Recently I ran my latest AirPods through the washer. Caught it early… but honestly too late, the charging case was full of water and went directly into rice. R.I.P old ear buds.  They didn’t make it , let’s have a moment of silence for them plz…Okay ! So the new AirPod pro 2(second gen) came and I instantly patted myself on the back for opting for the $199 upgrade just to see if all the hype was true.. it is !!The second I put them in my ears, the entire world arround me disappeared. Silence to the point of “is that fan off? Because normally it’s loud AF, thought me, took out the AirPods and yup it was still loud.The noise cancellation is insanely good !!The amazing sound quality of music is just that, amazing, and this little bundle of joy is worth its weight in gold with all of the customizable settings they offer, heck you can even take a pic of your ear and it will tell u what supplied plug covers are best suited for your ear, as well as a sound test option to make sure you are getting every cent out of these.Now I also bought a waterproof/crush proof case, the Catalyse ones you see in pic above so we don’t have anymore washing machine accidents.So the question still remains, is the extra $100 dollars for pro 2’s worth it ?For me that’s a resounding yes.Never would I opt for “refurbished” AirPods.. nothing about that sounds appealing.These should last me at least a couple of years, where as my old basic AirPods might have lasted 6 months. I found that the basic ones sound and stuff diminished rapidlySo “treat yo-self” to the AirPod 2 pros, again I repeat, the second I put them in my ears, I knew I made the right decision.So why don’t you?Get a protective case too, they are amazing.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024"

    Better than my older AirPods with hearing augmentation","No surprises since my older iPods  works similarly aside from the new customized hearing augmenting technology. That and a Prime Day price point. My older iPhone 8 only provides usual AirPod listening and dictation but to get the hearing customized I turned to my iPad with the mandatory 18z iOS to create my customization with the hearing test. The 8 only supports iOS to 14.7x. Good excuse to upgrade my 8 to a modest refurbed SE. I don’t need a multi-lens camera and qadzillions of pixels to have a functioning cellphone for goodness sake! The AirPods pro 2 do a nice job but figuring things out with the pitiful picture-ladened leaflet is really cheesy. Even a Q-code to get to the pertinent sections would be nice don’t ya think? Why make it complicated Mr Apple?….If I use these AirPods with other devices I have to re-pair every time and not always the first effort works. Microwave dings are now readily audible but so is the defrost refrig fan - a bit annoying. Hasn’t eliminated the age-related tinnitus. I’m still getting used to wearing them. One ear canal is more sensitive to prolonged wearing. I haven’t worn them past 4+ hrs yet, working up to the 5-6 hrs most reviewers have seen. So, If you’re wearing an older generation AirPod and you see a decent price in $150+ range it’s a pretty good deal. I wish the connectivity was easier. It seems to default to the noise cancellation more often that I like and I have to figure out how to get back to the settings on various devices. You do need iOS upgrade to at least 18x to get full functionality. Recommend with those caveats.","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2024"

    Best earbuds for iPhone!","At first, you might want to find the perfect ear tips, as it may be a little bit big or small for your ear. After a while it’ll be the perfect fit for your ears! The microphone works really great on phone calls and recordings alike. They’re extremely durable, as I’ve dropped them several times in the ground, bricks, counter, metal stoves, etc. and not a scratch! I don’t use them for workouts much, but they stay in my ears fairly easy even during cold weather, hot weather, sweat, water, and more. One thing is that they don’t stay in all night when you fall asleep, but don’t get damaged being crushed and rolled over!!","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025"

    Great Earbuds!","I LOVE these earbuds. They DO NOT fall out of my ears. There are three different size adjustments to choose from, and the smallest ones fit perfectly. I barely know they are in my ears. The sound is incredible, and the noise cancelling is good. I haven't tried them on an airplane yet, but so far, so good. The hearing aid aspect is good for someone with a mild hearing deficit. I do not know if they would be appropriate for someone with a major hearing loss, which a professional should determine. I learned from the hearing test that you take on an iPhone that I have a mild deficit in my right ear. When I wear the earbud in my right ear my hearing is definitely improved. Again, you will need to judge that aspect for yourself. Bottom line...they fit, don't fall out, great noise cancelling ability, and sound amazing.","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2025"

    Outstanding Sound and Noise Cancellation","I recently picked up the Apple AirPods Pro 2, and I’m honestly blown away by how much they’ve improved. The sound quality is outstanding—rich, detailed, and clear across all types of music. The high-fidelity sound really stands out, especially when paired with the personalized spatial audio, which makes everything feel immersive. I love how the sound adjusts to my head movements, creating a more dynamic listening experience.The active noise cancellation (ANC) is incredible. I use these to tune out distractions during my commute or when I need to focus, and they work like a charm. Whether I’m on a noisy subway or just in a crowded room, the ANC blocks out most of the background noise, making it easy to hear my music or podcast clearly. There’s also the Transparency mode, which is great when I need to hear my surroundings without taking the earbuds out. It’s a perfect balance, especially if you’re walking or biking and still need to stay aware of your environment.Setup was super easy, just like with all Apple products. The seamless integration with my iPhone was a breeze, and connecting via Bluetooth was instant. The new H2 chip definitely delivers—everything feels snappy, and the sound quality is even more refined than the previous model.One feature that stood out to me is the hearing aid capability. It’s a nice touch for anyone who might need it, and it works surprisingly well. I didn’t expect this feature to be as useful as it is, but it made a difference in certain situations where I wanted to hear conversations more clearly without turning the volume up too high.The fit is comfortable and secure, thanks to the various ear tip sizes that help create a perfect seal. I can wear these for hours without discomfort. The new USB-C charging is a welcome upgrade too—charging is faster and more convenient, especially if you’re using other USB-C devices.There’s very little to complain about, but I will note that, like most true wireless earbuds, the battery life could be a bit longer if you’re using ANC and high volumes constantly. But with the charging case, I’ve found that it’s easy to top them off throughout the day.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"

    Try the different ear tip sizes","I'm using this as ear plugs for my work office.  My first use it reduced but did not eliminate noise but then I tried the larger ear tips, and it was as if the world stopped.  I was blown away by how well it worked.  It's expensive but it works and is more comfortable than full sized headphones.  The 6hr charge is good enough because it recharges very quickly.Some more bells and whistles1. It has a transparency mode for driving to allow outside sounds. never use noise cancellation when driving :-)2. It easily pairs w/my iPhone to use as general purpose ear buds and microphone.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

    Better than I expectee","I had been using a pair of Edifier earbuds for a while, which worked pretty well and had features such as noise cancelling.  I figured the Airpods Pro 2 would be similar, but they have some subtle extras that are really nice.  Being able to charge it with a magsafe charger is convenient.  It seems to integrate a bit better with the iPhone, as you'd imagine.  And most of all, the sound is really good.  I haven't done any back-to-back comparisons between this and other earbuds, but subjectively, I think it's quite good.  And then there's the hearing-aid functionality; what a great addition.So far, I don't think the noise cancellation is that different from other brands, and it just seems more similar than different to those Edifiers, but as always, Apple seems to have a more polished result.","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025"

I used them when going out and at family gatherings. I had separate ear buds for watching TV. I also turned up the volume on my mobile phone. These earbuds pro do all that in one device! After the hearing test, it adapted it to all my hearing needs. My hearing aid were not as comfortable as these, and I don’t have to keep replacing the batteries.

    The best headphones I've ever used","I've been using wireless audio devices since the original AirPods released, including the original AirPods, Beats X, Pixel Buds, Beats Flex, 2 different pairs of Anker Soundcore buds, and a pair of JBL over ears, and the AirPods Pro 2 are the best by far. The transparency mode allows me to have stereo audio while still being able to hear my surroundings incredibly well, while the noise cancelling mode cuts out 99% of the background audio. The gym at my university doesn't have a wall between the equipment area and the basketball courts, and these are able to drown out around 20 people playing basketball easily. The ability to wirelessly charge through standard Qi, Apple Watch chargers, and Magsafe chargers also means that I didn't have to worry about putting cables around my apartment to keep them charged, as I can just put them on my watch charger I have at my bed and desk.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    Love em","I have moderate hearing loss. I have used prescription hearing aids from Costco and OTC Eargo 6 with very little success. When I saw these headphone/hearing aids on sale for $155 in early December I said why not give them a try a minimum they would be good headphones. It took over 2 weeks for them to arrive and instructions are not very good. Thank goodness for You Tube. That said, once I ran a hearing test and had them up and running I am thrilled with how much they have improved my hearing. I love them. I wear them around the house and even to parties. People say that they are uncomfortable wearing them out socially because people will think you’re listening to music or something. Never had anyone ask me if I’m listening to music. I also wear them to the gym and put them in noise canceling mode. Cuts out all the noise. I have also linked them with Roku and can listen to audio from TV/streaming without bothering others in early morning.I would highly recommend these to anyone with mild or moderate hearing loss who is is reasonably tech savvy. If you want a pair of hearing aid that you can simply put in your ears and hear without any tweaking don’t buy this product. But for less than $200 it’s a great deal!!","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

    Perfect for casual wear!","I was skeptical if I would enjoy AirPods and be able to keep track of them. I have had them for several months now and love them! I'm happy I spent a little more to get the Pro versus the original because the silicone makes all the difference when it comes to fit and comfort.My favorite time to use is casual wear, while I'm working, shopping, or doing house work. I have worn them to workout and the increased warmth of the body can make them slide around more and I feel like I can still hear a decent amount (with noise cancel feature on) within the gym environment.Also happy to report that I have not yet lost them! The tracking ability feature is huge to help locate them if I leave in a coat pocket or generally don't put them right back in the case.The battery life is amazing.

    Great for the limitations they have in regards to audio quality.","I wear these for a reason you will probably never read about anywhere else.  I almost always reach for my open-back over ear headphones so I can listen to lossless and I prefer the more natural soundstage with more minimal treble brightness over-emphasis.  I put on these AirPods for a while every now and then because it does one main thing that I like.  I like the fact that after wearing them for a while. I get a lot of earwax out of my ears the next day which in turn makes my wired headphones sound even better as well.  The closed back bass pumping in my ears does this.  This “feature” will work with any in-ear monitor.  The other feature I enjoy is the wireless design for when I am doing things like cooking.  They sound great I would give them an 8.0 out of 10. Amazon also proved the best price for these and they are genuine.  First thing I checked.  I also really love the soft braided usb-c cable that Apple includes with their products now including these AirPods.  Though I will miss the lightning connector.  I was able to put my deoxit metal contact enhancer on the lightning connector and I cannot with the usb-c.  Only downside.  When companies start utilizing lossless with wireless headphones then I may make the permanent switch, but as is… I feel it may be impossible for wireless headphones to ever achieve the fidelity of wired.  Even if lossless implemented.  But we will see.","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2024"

    Apple AirPod pro 2","Apple AirPod pro 2 is an upgrade version. It changes to finally USB C charging and MagSafe. It also adds a function of hearing aid. I am satisfied with this product, but dissatisfied with the seller selling the product box safety seals damaged on its arrival.  The product seller sold me the product of which the box packaging is so in defect that price is low at $153. This box is so messy with a dirty mark. This is not in latest production made in  Vietnam in 2023. On the other hand, Apple products have restrictions to be sold outside USA, it is impossible for a return and a refund from international. Amazon provides only local return in USA. I don’t know if Amazon will internationally provide any replacement in case of defective products. International customers must be aware of this situation.Since I am unable to have this AirPod pro 2 returned, I went to Apple website to check the device coverage before unboxing in order to  check if it functions or not. Inside the box, everything is brand-new and not activated. It is available for purchase of Apple protection care. I love Apple products quality most. Then I cancel return and adopt it for my use. In this review, I haven’t it activated yet.  I will put it to test later and make comments.","Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2025"

    Apple AirPod Pro 2","After a couple of weeks of use and comparing these to my older Bose Quiet Comfort Ear Buds, I like the sound quality and the lighter weight on the ears.  I am having a problem with the fit.  Apple supplies four sizes of ear cushions, ..... all of them too big for me.  I can't get them deep enough into the ear canal to get a solid fit.  The AirPods always feel like they are going to fall out (and a few times they did).  I contacted Apple support and they do not have a cure at this time.  I also feel like my older Bose did a better job at noise cancellation but that might have something to do with the fit.  Most people probably wouldn't have this concern and these would be a good choice.  One determining factor in trying the AirPod Pro 2's was the new hearing test app and well as the ability to use these as hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss individuals.  The software update for needed for this wasn't out yet at the time of reviewing this product and on a iPhone, you require IOS 18 or higher, also just coming out.","Reviewed in the United States on November 18, 2024"

I've had them for a year they work pretty decent but there have been newer versions that have come out and I worry what happens when they do decide to crap out. I was looking into the difference between buying the pro version versus just the regular AirPods. The pro version talks about noise cancellation and adaptive audio.One of the first things that I did when I got mine was I did a hearing test. I thought that was really awesome that it can help establish if you have a hearing issue. Or for them to even act as hearing aids which I also think is fantastic.But I think what I was most impressed by was the noise cancellation I was sitting in my living room I had them in and I took one off and then put it back in I was completely impressed by the noise cancellation. I have the heater going in my house and I couldn't even hear it Until I took one of my AirPods out. These are highly impressive!","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2025"

The Air Pod Pro 2 are superior in all aspects- music play is outstanding and the hearing aid function is amazing. Volume lowers and voices take priority. When conversation is done music level returns. Without music they function as a true hearing aid - no squealing - no whistles. Cost more than others but well worth the price.The pods have a hearing aid test that checks your hearing and then automatically sets them up. As your hearing changes you can retake the test and adjust the pods.

The problem is that they won’t stay in my ears.  They’re too expensive to worry about them falling out all of the time so I hardly use them.  If you have the right anatomy and they stay in you would probably love them.  The left EarPod will stay put but the right falls out no matter what I do.  When I do have the one left EarPod in I can hear the pronunciation of the word better but I would rather have them both in.  If you’re a senior and you do get them and love them, you might want to look at some YouTube videos to learn how to use them.

    Probably the best Apple buy and a steal at sale price but a couple of issues","I was blown away with the sound and features of these airpods (and I am not easily impressed).  However, a couple of issues.  One I found that the standard fit is not terribly secure.  I had to add hooks for security and a tether to link the two airpods together.  They both connect on the stem so that fit is not affected.  Given the cost, you don't want to take a chance on losing one.  The hooks will help secure the pods in your ear, and the tether will help prevent loss.  The use of both is optional, of course.  You can get both for about $10.  The main downside of the hooks an tether is that they have to be removed to be able to place the airpods in the charger, so get hooks that are easy to remove.  Second issue is the tips, which are special to the airpods pro.  I found that the small, medium, large, and the ones that come with it, were not sufficient for a tight fit.  Probably will need others.  Luckily, the fit can be tested by the iphone.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Great hearing aids, easy setup","My mom has hearing problems, but she flat out refuses to get hearings aids. I don’t blame her-I wouldn’t either. I convinced her to try the AirPod Pro 2 and she agreed. When they first arrive, you will have to make sure the phone’s iOS is updated to the most recent version, pair the AirPods to the phone, and then put the AirPods in the case to charge for a bit. They will update their own software while charging. After that, the AirPods will be available for setup in the phone’s settings. I highly recommend doing the ear fit test before the hearing test- that way you know the hearing test results are accurate. One of her ears is worse than the other, so she wears that one AirPod when she needs to hear. That’s a great selling point for anyone who resists getting hearing aids, and it’s been working great for her.

Highs and mids were crisp, the bass was super rich especially with enhancement through third-party equalizers such as Boom. The Bose app which is required, was not difficult to use. Immersive sound was fantastic. Noise cancellation was top in class. Bluetooth is a bit annoying, with occasional drops. The Bose two source Bluetooth set up in the app is a bit squirrelly and is better set up as a one source item.The Beats also had crisp highs and mids, however, the bass was somewhat wanting. In order to make the bass sound more punchy, the volume of the mids and highs is lessened during the hits in order to make it sound like there’s more bass than there actually is. I call this “fake bass“. The H1 chip makes it work well with Apple products and the immersive sound is good. Noise canceling is par. The ear fin does help hold them in your ear, but does get uncomfortable after a long period of use.The Apple AirPods also had crisp highs and mids, but the bass again was somewhat wanting. The AirPods had the same issue with “fake bass“. Enhancement with third-party equalizers doesn’t usually sound too good. Seems like these earbuds are meant for plug n play without any equalizer input from the user. The H2 chip sounds really nice with immersive sound.  Noise cancellation was also par.

I don't understand the hype for these.The sound quality is mediocre.The noise cancellation is top tier.The battery life is awful. The portable chargers battery life is also subpar.It constantly falls out of your ear. I know they have customizable options or attachments (3rd party) you can buy to fix that -- but when you're spending this much money it shouldn't be an issue in the first place.The price is way too much for what it offers. As of writing this review it's $180+. You could get far better over-the-ear wireless headphones for the same cost. With a 12h+ or even 24h+ battery life, better sound qualify, and more comfortable.The connection is horrible. I can't even walk to the kitchen without losing connection or getting a bunch of static. Which sucks, because that was one of my main reasons deciding on buying these. But what really sucks is that they don't reconnect properly. If it gets to static I have to turn them off and on or even when I'm back in a strong signal area it'll remain choppy audio. If I lose audio completely I also have to turn my Bluetooth off and on to reconnect them. They don't auto-reconnect.So the only real reason to buy these is because you don't want to wear something as bulky as over-the-ear headphones or want to be able to hide your headphones from other people seeing them. Part of my intention for buying it was for working out... but they just fall out too much. I'm not sure why it's such an issue. I don't have that issue with wired headphones of similar design. I get there's a wire stabilizing it... but it's not stabilizing it that much. Especially with how I like to wear mine as loose as possible.Overall... I regret the purchase. I have a $400+ set of over-the-ear wireless headphones and normally I wouldn't even consider wasting money on these. But a plastic piece broke and I'm unable to repair it meaning one side of the headphones just flops around and even trying to stabilize it with glue/tape never really made it better.I'd return these but I feel kind of weird about returning something that's been in my ear for countless hours. It's not like these don't have a purpose still though. They're always great as a back-up and are good for travelling.If you view these as only using in small bursts (4 hours or less) then these are pretty decent though still overpriced. Might have to waste another $15+ to get an attachment to keep it in your ear... but the concept of the earbuds are decent.It just kind of makes me wonder if there's better options out there. A superior product. I'm honestly disappointed in these and will probably rarely ever use them again when I eventually get something better or fix my other headset somehow.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

    I Had to Fake the Hearing Test to Turn On the Hearing Aid Feature","iPhone Settings would not let me turn on the  Airpod Pro II “Hearing Aid” feature because I had Severe Loss in one ear (instead it told me to see an Audiologist) so I took the Hearing Test again and faked it by indicating I heard a tone even when I didn’t. I scored a Moderate hearing loss and it then allowed me to turn on the Hearing Aid feature.I hear OK in one ear and I like the other Airpod features like ANC for traveling.I am very happy now.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    Good for music but has changing issues","The sound quality is great, and I like using them for music, but the noise cancellation feature felt pretty uncomfortable for me. It’s disconcerting when you can’t hear what’s going on around you, so I ended up turning it off—and I’m much happier without it.What I Liked: • Great Sound: Music and podcasts sound crisp and clear. • Tracking Feature: This feature was a lifesaver when some teens picked up my earbuds when I sat them down at the park. I used my phone to track them down and got them back!What Could Be Better: • Noise Cancellation: If you like being aware of your surroundings, this might not be the feature for you. • Charging Quirks: Sometimes I have to adjust or remove the soft cushions before placing them in the case to make sure they charge properly.  I almost sent them into be serviced until I realized you could just remove the cushions to get them to seat properly and charge.Overall, these earbuds are great for sound quality and have cool features like tracking, but they come with a few quirks.  In my opinion still the best on the market.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025"

    Amazing","I would give these airpods a rating on 6+ if I could.  They are amazing, and way beyond the other noise-canceling earphones I have tried.  The most amazing feature is the hearing test and the way that the airpods adjust to my specific hearing issues.  I didn't know, but was not surprised, that as an older man, my ability to hear high frequencies had decreased.  Not enough to be alarming, and not enough to even notice.  Overall the test indicated that my hearing was  ormal, but did drop off at higher frequencies. I did feel that most music I listened to was a bit drab, and thought it had to do with compression.  The airpods changed all that - the high frequencies are back, and my music sounds much "brighter" and livelier.  These have really made music and audio much more enjoyable.  I will also mention that the noise cancellation feature is as good as it gets.  I can tune out a noisy coffee shop almost 100%!  Amazing performance and for such a reasonable price.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025"

    Liking these more than I expected","I got these to have something to listen to during long and boring hours at work. Overall, I like them quite a bit.The sound quality is quite good. Everything sounds wide and clear. While I am no audiophile, I do still appreciate these qualities.They are also super convenient. I don't have to press any buttons or wait super long for them to turn on. I just pop them in my ears and they are ready to go. I do also appreciate the added features for using them with iOS. The functionality in the Find My app has me at ease because I know that it will be easy to locate them if lost.The build quality is also quite nice.My only gripe is that I can't quite get the fit right. I tried the different tips and even with the one that fits best, the airpods can work their way out of my ears with relative ease.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

    BEFORE YOU BUY Great as hearing aids if you know what you are doing.","I actually bought these 4 different times because the first 3 did not say Air Pods Pro 2 on the box; it just said Air Pods Pro. If you look at the bottom of the box it will say 2nd generation. I was not made aware of this till after returning 3 boxes and finally bought them from Best Buy. The guy at the register gave me a box that said Air Pods Pro. I said this is not the Air Pods Pro 2 as you see that these are labeled here on Amazon. He said the 2nd generation is the Air Pods Pro 2, but it doesn't say that on the box. Wish I had known this.Also I could not access the hearing aid app, till I went on Youtube where I saw a short video by Danielle Ridley called  How to get NEW Hearing Features on the AirPods Pro 2 - Fix!.  The biggest thing i learned is your must have ios 18.1 or better. The MOST IMPORTANT THING to get the hearing aid feature turned on; you MUST PUT THE PODS AND THEIR CONTAINER NEXT TO OR ON TOP OF YOUR PHONE WHILE IT CHARGES so the phone will upload the hearing aid feature. I hope this helps. I have owned expensive hearing aids, in the past. I think these are the best i have owned.","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    Next Level","I already had an Airpod Pro second generation that work well, but being a mature gentleman, I wanted these mainly as a gateway to hearing augmentation.  In short, this overdelivered in a good way.Once I got my phone upgraded, then waited for the firmware to be upgraded on the Airpods (yeah, you just sit there and wait), I finally got to take my hearing test with these.  It said I have minor hearing loss in my left ear and pretty much no hearing loss in my right.  All good.  Next, I turned on the hearing aid mode and was ushered into a rich world of sound.These things are really amazing as hearing aids.  While the sound was a little like sandpaper on a snare drum in a way, I could hear EVERYTHING.  I had no idea that a bare foot on carpet was so loud and distinctive, that you can tell who is coming.  It was like nothing I have experienced recently.As far as being a headset, the noise cancellation is phenomenal.  I fired up my random orbit sander and dialed in my workbench in peace and only a very pleasant, quiet sound.  I popped one out to make sure, and it was startling.  These things really do work in noise cancellation, almost as well as my 3M cup type hearing protection!I have been an engineer for over 35 years, and it takes a lot to blow my wig back, but these things did just that.If you are young, maybe they are only "great", but as a gentleman of 57 years, these are well and truly amazing.  If you are over 50, you need these in your life.","Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2024"

    I absolutely love my AirPods Pro 2‘S.","! I have six sets scattered around my house because I use them all the time. The sound quality is phenomenal with the personalized spatial audio, and the active noise cancellation is unmatched—it completely transforms any listening experience. The recent update that added the hearing aid feature is a game-changer, making them even more versatile and practical. Noice cancelling works so well. They’re incredibly comfortable, and the transparency mode works perfectly for staying aware of my surroundings when needed. These are worth every penny, and I couldn’t be happier with them!","Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2025"

    Didn’t know I needed them until I got them","My wife and daughter use the original Air Pods and I have to admit, I have borrowed them a couple of times. I wear hearing aids so it wasn’t necessarily easy to have both.  But, when I read where the AirPod 2 had hearing enhancements, so decided to purchase a pair as the price was pretty good.  For some strange reason, I did have to change out the buds to smaller ones as they standard that came wouldn’t stay in my ears when I was hiking.  Otherwise, I’ve enjoyed wearing them.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    Impressive sound after doing hearing test and frequency response adjustment","I did purchase this AirPod Pro 2 for helping my hearing in large echoey classrooms and killing background noise in restaurants.However, when I tried the units with spatial audio and head tracking selected, especially when listening to concerts online, the sound was immersive, had great ambience, transients, and bass; sounding much like a Dolby Atmos system. Most impressive is when I turn my head and the sound source remains in place with the hearing frequency response changing as it would in an actual live situation.The hearing aid feature. After the hearing test was completed, and the AirPods automatically adjusted to my hearing losses, my hearing became as good as a bird. I could hear scraping of my shoes on a carpet, squeaking floors, distant sounds that I had not ever been able to hear. All this does depends on how good you’re hearing is in the first place. I had an audiology hearing report that I scanned into my iPad, which I could even tweak. That was a little better than the AirPod internal test.This purchase was well above my expectations using my Apple iPad.The sound quality was not anything to write home about with an Android phone. For that I would purchase something else as there is no dedicated app for the AirPod.I did need to watch a couple YouTube videos for setting up the AirPods, as the enclosed manual was not helpful.  Apple online documentation was fine, but not as good as watching someone actually doing a set up.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2024"

    Seamless integration with Apple products, great quality sound","I bought these to use for noise cancellation when traveling. I wear hearing aids full time, but they don't do much to reduce unwanted noise and are uncomfortable for long periods of time under noise-cancelling headphones. In my research I discovered that some earbuds now offer noise cancellation - and they'd fit more easily into my already tightly-packed personal item for flights. So I figured I could just switch out my hearing aids for the AirPods while on the plane. I was comparing reviews on these and the Bose Quiet Comfort II. Even though the Bose were rated slightly higher for noise cancellation, I decided to go with the Apple product because of the ease of linking to my other Apple devices.I haven't had a chance to test them out on a plane yet, but preliminary checks with a nearby hair dryer and vacuum indicate they'll be pretty effective. The sound quality is superb, and they are comfortable in my ears. I love that they come with 4 sizes of ear tips to allow for a good fit. The case is tiny, easy to fit in a pocket, and charges on an Apple watch or MagSafe charger or with a USB-C.I expected to use these only when traveling or in other loud environments. The surprise has been that I find myself wearing them at home in the evening, when I'm apt to be going between phone, iPad and computer for various uses. My hearing aids connect fine to my phone, but switching the bluetooth on them to another device is so cumbersome that I never even bother trying anymore. In contrast, once they are initially linked, the Apple AirPods connect automatically to all three devices and switch between them seamlessly. With the 30' bluetooth range, I have the freedom to move between rooms and still hear whatever I was listening to without having to carry a device with me. Even with significant hearing loss, the AirPods' clear sound allows me to take calls and hear the caller distinctly, and the outgoing microphone sound is also clear.","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    These!","I was between these and a full size over the ear headset for noise cancellation. I went with these for ease of portability when traveling, multiple size ear bud tips, battery life and promised noise cancellation feature. Very satisfied with all of these features. As to noise cancellation, I wore them on several flights and heard nothing from my neighbors, seat mates and their devices, or even the flight  attendant offering beverages! Better still I could have the volume turned low and still experience excellent sound quality, another big plus if you have sensitive hearing. The standard size tips stayed put in my ears altho I prefer the next size down and pleased to have this option. I am not a tech person but the prompts to pair them  with your device and to check/charge battery life could not be easier. For me, these are worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025"

One slight downside is that the pod batteries lasts for 6 hours.  Put them in the case and you are close to a full charge within 30 minutes.

    Wow, just wow!","Weather you are going from the first gen pros, normal AirPods, or any other headphones (except the AirPods Max) I’m sure you will be blown away by these, the sound quality is unbelievable, and the bass, the bass is insane! You might think that since they are earbuds that you might not be able to feel the bass, but not quite, for me, it’s like I have a actual bass next to me, it’s like it uses your heartbeat to make it feel like bass is around you, especially when you really feel the music, even though the beat isn’t right on with your heartbeat, that is the best I can describe it. And I do t k ow what happened, but with the iOS 18.1 update, everything changed in how good the audio was,  I came from the AirPods Pro 1st generation, so when I swapped to 2nd generation the audio difference strangely wasn’t much better, but after the iOS update, it was crazy! It sounded like there was the band or orchestra playing around me and swapping from ear to ear and fading, it feels more open and waaaay better! It is quite hard to describe, it’s really just something you have to try for yourself. I am absolutely blown away by these AirPods, these are the best sound quality earbuds I’ve ever put on, better than any headset I’ve put on! And the new speaker on the case is a nice piece of mind to have, I haven’t used the lanyard loop before but that’s just me. And the tracking for these in find my is so good, that I can lose them, and I can play the sound and use the find my app and it will play a have if hot and cold with me and it is accurate! One of my favorite features of these compared to the 1st generation is the volume control on the stem of the AirPod itself, I use this all the time. I highly recommend these!Edit: I found out why it was sounding so good and it is just the spacial audio on them that I toggled on, but still unbelievable sound.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Hearing Aid Function - Works As Described","I liked the idea of Airpods, but a Bluetooth enabled set of earbuds wasn't enough to make me jump at the price.  However, as the Airpod 2 claimed to double as a hearing aid for people with mild to moderate hearing loss I was intrigured, though weary, as I have a pair of $1500 hearing aids by Kirkland (rebranded Phonak) that work but, are fairly uncomfortable and take a lot of maintenance including battery replacement.  Not only do the Airpod 2's work as well, but they are comfortable and at this price point and maintenance level, I'm thrilled.

The noise cancellation feature is nothing short of remarkable; it effortlessly blocks out distractions, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or podcasts. With the new adaptive transparency mode, I can seamlessly transition between enjoying my tunes and being aware of my surroundings, making them perfect for daily commutes.The sound quality is another standout feature. The deep bass, clear mids, and sparkling highs create an immersive audio experience that rivals many high-end headphones. Whether I'm listening to my favorite playlist or catching up on audiobooks, every note feels rich and vibrant. The spatial audio feature takes it a step further, providing an almost theatrical experience that is truly a game-changer.Battery life is fantastic as well. I find that I can easily get through a full day of use without needing to recharge, and the wireless charging case is incredibly convenient. For those who are always on the go, the quick connect feature with my Apple devices is a lifesaver; I can switch between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook without missing a beat.Overall, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro 2 enough. They beautifully blend functionality, style, and top-tier performance, making them a must-have accessory for anyone who values high-quality audio and convenience in their daily life.

This new one has usb-c which is so much nicer since my iphone is also usb-c. I'm glade Apple ditched it or were force to ditch it. That said, there are some small noticeable improvements over the previous model even though they both have the same name. It feels more solid for some reason and fits slightly better in the ear. The volume control is actually easier to slide now but it wasn't difficult before. My old one also made an annoying howling noise when it is over a pillow.

They charge quickly in the secure carry case, but older users, like me (77) may find it difficult to remove the  pods from their case because of the secure magnetic connection. I actually like how well they fit and consider it a minor but justifiable nuisance to remove them with my neurologically challenged hands. However, because they work so well, I can overlook this minor inconvenience. I have also tried using them a few times as hearing aid supplements, and they work pretty well (e.g., lectures).

    AirPods Pro 2s are excellent with 2 caveats.","I purchased the AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe Charging Case/USB-C (A3047, A3048) and they are impressive.  The noise cancellation is outstanding, the Spatial Audio is incredible for earbuds and the different listening modes are fascinating.  They also charged quickly and are easy to pair.  Now for the 2 issues.  First, by using these earbuds, I found out that I have sensitivity to silicone in my ears so they caused irritation when I used these for more than 15 minutes.  Since I like these so much and Apple does not offer silicone-free ear tips, I purchased non-silicone tips (medium) from Amazon and I can now use these without irritation.  The other issue is that, although I was able to pair them with my LC C3, the Bluetooth connection suffered intermittent gaps in the audio. I tested watching the same movie on my iPad- no issues.  I'll work with LG to get this resolved.  For me, it's worth keeping these because they are truly outstanding","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024"

While I have received positive feedback on the product’s quality and authenticity, I have encountered some problems.

I suspect that the software or a hardware malfunction may be the cause.Despite these concerns, the audio quality remains excellent, and I have used the earbuds extensively while commuting by bus and train.

    Great for hearing aid","I have tried a few hearing aids and I find they just don’t do it. This is good for hearing. It’s great for blocking out all noise. And it’s great to play music. I really am enjoying them. The only thing I wish they had a longer life Than six hours. I guess because I wear them almost all day. The case stays charge so if I need to, I can put them in for a while and they will charge again.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

    These work great, but are a little overpriced if you buy them at retail price.","I bought these AirPod Pros on sale for $170 and have been very impressed with them. I work in a very loud environment, so the noise-cancellation mode helps reduce the sounds of what’s going on around me while producing clear sounds. Additionally, the battery life on these ear buds are fantastic; Sometimes, I don’t charge them for weeks.One of my favorite new features to AirPods is their “Find My” app accuracy. When I lost my original AirPod’s I would panic because the “Find My” wasn’t very precise and depended largely on when the last time they were used. However, the new feature allows you to literally track your lost AirPod case at anytime (with battery life) and takes the stress away of worrying if you left them at the gas station, store, or a friends house.Although these get a ton of hype, I am not super impressed with some of the features. The transparency mode always creates a lot of static sounds that distract from what is playing. The tips do not fit my ears like the original AirPods, so they are constantly falling out of my ear. I am also not very fond of the limited touch control options available with these AirPod’s. You cannot skip, restart, or go back to old songs, like with the original AirPod’s—it seems they digressed a little there—and I know this sounds picky, but it was very important to me as I am not always near my phone or am able to command Siri in my environment.I am very impressed with what has been offered in this product, but it is overpriced, like much of what Apple offers.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024"

My husband would rather wear this product and hears better with them than his very expensive hearing aids.  Setting them up is a bit of a challenge but worth the effort.  The ability to recharge them is  much more cost effective than replacing batteries in hearing aids that were prescribed for him. We would order these again and would recommend them to others.","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2025"

The quality of the sound and the noise cancellation is just beyond any headphone I’ve ever owned these headphones are amazing for the price. I will never buy nothing else, but AirPod Pro headphones.The durability of them is made good with good plastic good material the little rubber pieces on the end that inserts into the ear are made good the rubber on the end with a plastic piece that attaches to the head phone itself, which is amazing that way you don’t lose your little rubber pieces as often.  For the size they’re perfect size. The case holds a six hour charge in each headphone has a six hour duration range and the microphone on it is one of the best that I’ve ever used on any AirPod. I can go probably about 500 feet away from my case before they cut out which is amazing. They’ve got killer range.  For an overall review of a five star this is now my new favorite AirPod.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025"

    Great earbuds, but the fit with the Apple ear tips is beyond dreadful for some ears","Overall, I'm satisfied with the actual sound (coming from a previous slightly "v-shaped" sound profile pair of earbuds these ones do sound a little bit "boring" but I can live with that), and the noise cancellation feature works well for long-haul plane trips. However, just be aware that the ear tips that come with this won't work at all for some ears (I couldn't get any of the sizes to work in my ears). I bought a third-party brand of ear tips (KASOTT Upgraded Memory Foam Ear Tips Version 5.0), which completely solved the fit problem, and now I'm immensely happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025"

 Great AirPods, but…","These work great but aren’t as loved as the generation 2 AirPods. They work well, have held up for months with no issues, connect to iPhone with no problem, and are worth the money. They seem to be made well.
However, they’re a little wider than the generation 2 AirPods. Because of this, they sometimes want to come out of my ears. I didn’t have this problem with my previous AirPods.
Overall, these are great but I prefer generation 2 AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

 Superior Comfort","The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) have quickly become my go-to wireless earbuds, offering a fantastic blend of immersive sound quality, comfort, and convenience. The personalized spatial audio feature is a standout, creating an immersive listening experience that makes music and podcasts feel more engaging. The sound is crisp and well-balanced, with impressive bass that doesn’t overpower the mids and highs.

One of the best aspects is the comfort. The redesigned shape fits snugly in my ears, and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. They’re also sweat and water resistant, which is perfect for my workouts and outdoor activities. I don’t have to worry about them getting damaged by a bit of moisture, making them a reliable choice for various situations.

However, there are a few things to consider. While the sound quality is excellent, audiophiles might find it lacking compared to high-end, over-ear headphones. Additionally, the price is on the higher side, which might be a concern for those looking for more budget-friendly options.","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024"

 I like the 2nd generation ear fit","These ones hurt my ears physically. I guess my ears are too small. So if you don’t have small ears then they should fit fine. I have sores on the ridges on my ears. Similar to getting new shoes and you have sores on your lower ankles. You have to break them in I guess?

However the physical durability is outstanding! The bad news is they fell out of my case somehow. I don’t know how that happened as they magnetically connect to close. Lost them at work. I was able to track them and they in the gutter. It must have happened when I was loading my car up to leave. Found the next day. They were ran over BUT they still work! They still charge and the mute buttons work. Amazing! Even though I can’t use them because it’s just too painful. The size/shape doesn’t bother my teen. It still puzzles me how they got bumped out of the charging case and lost to begin with but thrilled it’s not a total loss.

 🎧 Immersive Sound, Seamless Tech, But Not Quite Perfect for Everyone","When I first unboxed these earbuds, I felt a mix of excitement and skepticism. Would they live up to the hype? Spoiler: For the most part, they absolutely do but not without a couple of quirks.

🏆 The Good Stuff
Let me start with what blew me away: the sound. The bass is rich without overwhelming the mids and highs, creating a balanced listening experience. Pairing them with my phone was as effortless as opening the case they were ready to go before I even blinked. The spatial audio is no gimmick either; it adds a layer of immersion that makes you feel like you’re at a live concert.

Battery life? A solid win. I used them for nearly seven hours on a single charge, and the charging case gave me multiple full charges. It’s like having a mini powerhouse in my pocket.

🛑 The Not-So-Good
But—and this is a big one for me—the fit isn’t universal. If you’re someone who plans to use these during intense workouts or while running, you might find yourself readjusting them more often than you’d like. For casual use, they’re snug, but for activities, it’s a bit hit or miss.

Why It Stands Out
What really sets these apart is the combination of features and usability. I walked through multiple rooms in my house, and the connection remained rock solid a level of reliability I haven’t seen in many other earbuds. The controls are intuitive, and the subtle aesthetic of the design makes them feel premium.

Should You Buy Them?
If you’re looking for earbuds that excel in sound quality, ease of use, and everyday convenience, these are a fantastic choice. Just be aware that if you’re an athlete or someone who’s always on the move, they might not check every box.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024"

 Balanced Sound and Comfort","The Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) have been a fantastic upgrade to my everyday audio experience. The personalized spatial audio is the standout feature—it creates an immersive listening environment, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or taking calls. The sound quality is crisp and well-balanced, with just the right amount of bass, and the adaptive EQ adjusts perfectly to whatever I’m listening to.

Comfort is another highlight. The earbuds have a lightweight, ergonomic design that fits securely without feeling intrusive, even during long listening sessions or workouts. They’re also sweat and water-resistant, which gives me peace of mind when I’m exercising or caught in the rain. The battery life is excellent; the earbuds last about six hours on a single charge, and the Lightning charging case extends it to an impressive 30 hours.

While I’m happy with the overall experience, I do miss the silicone ear tips from the AirPods Pro for added noise isolation. These don’t have active noise cancellation, so they’re not ideal in very noisy environments. Also, they work best within the Apple ecosystem, so Android users might not get the full feature set.

Overall, the 3rd Gen AirPods are a great choice for Apple users seeking high-quality wireless earbuds with excellent sound, comfort, and battery life. They strike a good balance between premium features and ease of use, making them a worthwhile investment.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    An Honest Review","First things first, I succumbed to Prime Day & couldn’t pass up the deal on these AirPods. Especially since with my current AirPods starting to crap out. However, I’m going to be giving this review from the perspective of going from the 2nd gen AirPod pros to the 3rd gen. And it seems like bit of a downgrade.Now, the 2nd gen pros have it all. The extra silicon tips, the noise cancellation & transparency, & the ability to wirelessly charge (the case). And I had them for a good long while (the longest I’ve had any AirPod) & the right bud is just starting to crackle when I play any audio through it and the battery is starting to go bad.Overall, I was honestly a little disappointed with the 3rd gen. Granted, it’s not a pro version so it’s not going to come with the noise cancellation. But the lack of silicon tips for the buds was a little surprising. I have trouble with any earbud staying in my left ear especially, & I’ve used the 3rd gen during a few workouts so far & they’re staying pretty well. But, they still feel just a little off & I ended up buying silicon tips to put over the buds instead - those helped with a bit of noise cancellation and security in my ears. But to go from the 2nd gen pros to the 3rd gen feels like I’m losing a lot when it comes to function & capabilities.Now, if you’re buying a pair of AirPods for the first time & just need the basics - then the 3rd gen is great. The bass sounds really good, overall sound quality is there & the buds without the silicon tips really aren’t that bad. If you’re used to that though, it’s going to take a bit to adjust with the 3rd gen. But, like I did, there are silicon tips you can get to put over the buds to help.","Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024"

    Good sound but new pod design doesn’t fit all ears","Got the Apple AirPods Gen 3 recently.  I like the improved sound the spatial awareness surround sound feature is nice.  I like that compared to the gen1, you can hear what is going on around you sound wise at the appropriate volumes.  The bass is rich, highs are good.  The controls work well, pods are well built of quality material.  Connectivity is good and does drop audio.I will say the only thing that I have a problem with the fit of the AirPods.  Unlike the gen 1 and 2 that just hangs well on my ears they’d seem a little loose.  When I smile I can feel them dislodging.  The smaller size makes it hard to handle if you have bigger hands.  While controls are responsive, depending on size of your hands it may be difficult to find the little indentation to control them.This model did not come with the wireless MagSafe charger case.

    Great Performance, But Packaging Issues and Battery Life Concerns","I’ve used Apple AirPods before, and I got my previous pair directly from Apple, which worked flawlessly until my dog chewed one of them. That’s why I decided to buy these on Amazon. However, I’m not sure if it’s because the seller wasn’t directly affiliated with Apple, but these AirPods seemed used when I received them. There was dust inside the box, and one of the AirPods even had earwax or something on it. That was a big letdown for what was supposed to be a brand-new product.As for the AirPods themselves, they work well. The sound quality and spatial audio are excellent, just like my original pair. However, the battery life hasn’t been as good as expected. For the first two weeks, they held a charge fine, but now, after just about a month, the battery doesn’t last as long as it should. It’s a bit frustrating, especially since I expected the same long-lasting battery performance as my previous pair.Overall, I still love the AirPods, but the condition in which they arrived and the battery issues have me questioning whether this was truly a new product. I’m not sure if this is an issue with the seller, but it’s something to be aware of if you’re purchasing from a non-Apple source.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024"

    I’m an apple stockholder and these are Apple’s biggest flop.","I purchased these the intention of using them with my iPhone 15 Pro. I have to say that I’ve never been able to keep the ear phones supplied with any of my Apple products in my ears. These AirPods proved to be an expensive mistake. The sound quality is not just superb. It’s fabulous, but that’s of no use when you can’t wear them in your ears they simply fall out immediately. I even purchased a little device that attaches to them in case they fall out of your ears or I should say when they fall out of your ears so that they don’t get lost in an airlines seat . Unfortunately, if I keep fussing with them, I can push them into my ears twist them in various directions and they may stay for 10 or 15 seconds. As much as I would like to keep them because the spatial sound feature is unbelievably great they are useless because they won’t allow me to keep them in my ! I mentioned earlier that I am an Apple stockholder. It’s a great concern to me that Apple makes products that sell. I don’t want my stock to lose value, but if they make ear phones that won’t stay in somebody’s head, then those sales are gonna plummet and if they plummet, they won’t make Apple any money and my stock will be worthless.i intend to write Tim Cook and complain about thesw. Yes, i know some folks can wear them, but EVERYONE should be able to. Now, to add insult to injury, I find I am not able to return them as my trip to Europe exceeded the return window.","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024"

    100% real","At first I didn’t know what AirPods to buy but I asked my friend so he suggested these AirPods 3rd gen So I bought it. I first I thought it will be fake or a scam. It took long but the wait time was worth it. Other companies may have the same offer but they could be fake but these are really 100% real. Don’t buy it from other retailers. Legit AirPods 3rd gen and it’s at a good price. Don’t worry this is real! It works 100% and there is nothing wrong with it. Enjoy but these when these offer won’t last long so I suggest buying these. Enjoy these offers until next time. Thank you Amazon!","Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2024"

    Pretty good but two main issues","I bought this for only $120 bucks and the audio is good, there are just two problems I have which is depending on where I put them in my ear they try to fall but I found a spot to where they don’t. My second issue is there is no noise cancellation but that is mainly on me for not reading the features.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024"

    easy to set up, great audio quality, personalized spatial audio is nice, no wireless charging","I got this as a birthday gift for my mother-in-law. She was looking for a hands-free device to talk to her old friend on the phone, but the headphones in the house were too heavy for long-term use. She has an iPhone 15 pro max so I got her the AirPods on Prime Day.Just like the older generations of AirPods (I own a pair of the 1st gen), these came partially charged, and the set up was very easy, just long-hold the button on the case and connect it to the phone.1 new feature is the personalized spatial audio that required an extra setup, but that only took an extra minute. My mother-in-law used it to watch some homemade videos she recorded and was surprised at how "dynamic" it sounds - for example, in one video, my father-in-law was laughing in the background and she thought he was actually behind her. Overall, it's easy enough for my mother-in-law to use and the audio quality is great. I haven't tested the battery life but it should be sufficient for multiple-hour-long phone calls.1 missing thing was wireless charging. I thought that all new-gen AirPod cases have that but this one doesn't. Not a dealbreaker though.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024"

    Ear buds seem large for my ears","I got these to replace my original AirPods 1st gen. The ear buds seem larger than the 1st gen ear buds, and I had a little trouble getting them to stay in my ears. If you have small ears, you are going to have a lot of trouble getting them to stay in. I haven't had a lot of time to test them out as they came with very little charge. They did pair easily and quickly with both my iPhone 15 and my iPad Air 11 inch (M2). The sound quality was good on the one song I listened to to test them out. Hopefully the battery life is longer than my 1st gen AirPods (which were only lasting about 20 minutes at the end).","Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2024"

I decided to send them back the next day to get the next generation. The only way to return them was through Amazon picking them up from my home through UPS. Then when they picked them up I didn't get my money back right away. I'm being told I won't get my money back for about 30 days. $182.00 that I won't be able to see for 30 days. That's if they send it at all. They were perfect when I sent them back, but I'm not sure I'll trust them until I get my money back.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2024"

    These are not fakes they are legit and worth every cent for people that like to listen to music but it has a lot more features little features like taking calls ,watching videos ,tapping on them ,sensing your ears for when you put in and on , and so much more I’m still learning. when you put them on they have a special design that makes that’s comfortable and can fit in anyone’s ear. Also when there in your ear there super light. The sound quality is way more than I need and has spatial audio that makes every sound feel like it’s coming from your room and not your AirPods. To enable it you have to hold on the sound button on your phone or go to the settings. And if you lost them you can track them with Find My. Overall I give it 5 stars. Theses have every thing you need. Would get these if this is your first time buying AirPods.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024"

 Apple AirPods Wireless Ear Buds, Bluetooth Headphones with Lightning Charging Case","The Apple AirPods are an excellent choice for anyone seeking high-quality wireless earbuds with seamless connectivity. Pairing with Apple devices is incredibly simple and almost instantaneous, thanks to the H1 chip, making these earbuds perfect for those deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem.

The sound quality is impressive, with balanced tones and clear audio, whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or making calls. The microphone quality for calls is also top-notch, ensuring your voice is heard clearly. The earbuds are lightweight, comfortable, and stay in place even during light physical activities.

The included Lightning Charging Case is compact and provides multiple charges, extending the AirPods' already decent battery life. While it would have been nice to have USB-C charging for more versatility, the Lightning connector works perfectly fine for Apple users.

Overall, these AirPods offer great convenience, reliable performance, and good sound quality. A must-have for any Apple user looking for wireless headphones!","Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2024"

 Great ear buds","I own many Apple products and have been using them with over-the-ear wireless headphones. While they work well the ease of carrying them with me made it difficult depending on where I was traveling. The Air Pods were an excellent alternative. I caught an Amazon special and got them for an excellent price. Although they were not the latest model they were new and have excellent sound. As with all Apple products they quality and build are excellent. The small size and excellent connectivity of the Bluetooth make them useful for traveling light.","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2025"

 Great Purchase","The AirPods worked great and the packaging was just the same as if I were to buy directly from the Apple Store. The AirPods charge very fast and stay in my ears snug. I am moving a lot in my job and they do not fall out. They are easy to use and all controls work as far as volume and slipping songs. Music quality is great, no issues with the sound.","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

 Amazing Sound and Convenience! Worth Every Penny! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","I couldn’t be happier with my AirPods! These earbuds have truly exceeded my expectations in every way. The sound quality is phenomenal, with deep bass, crisp highs, and a balanced midrange that makes listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls an absolute pleasure. The Active Noise Cancellation feature is a game-changer, effectively blocking out background noise so I can fully immerse myself in what I’m listening to. On the flip side, the Transparency Mode is perfect when I need to stay aware of my surroundings.

The seamless pairing with my devices is another huge plus. As an Apple user, switching between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook is effortless. The fit is secure and comfortable, even during long listening sessions or workouts, and I appreciate the sweat and water resistance for added durability. The battery life is excellent, and the case provides multiple charges, keeping me powered up all day.

Pros:

Outstanding sound quality with rich bass and clear audio.
Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode are impressive and easy to toggle.
Seamless pairing and switching between Apple devices.
Comfortable fit with multiple ear tip sizes included.
Excellent battery life and compact, portable charging case.
Cons:

Premium price point, though it’s justified by the quality.
Could be slightly uncomfortable for people with smaller ears after extended wear.
Overall, the AirPods are worth every penny if you're looking for top-notch wireless earbuds. They combine exceptional sound, convenience, and smart features in a sleek package. Highly recommended!","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Definitely worth every penny and then some","I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.

Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.
I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.

I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.

First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.
But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.
I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.
I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.
I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.

So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2020"

 Great for Everyday Use, But Not Perfect","The AirPods (2nd Gen) are a solid choice for wireless earbuds, and they’ve been a great companion for my day-to-day use. The pairing process with my iPhone was ridiculously easy—just open the case, and boom, they’re ready to go. The sound quality is decent, and the battery life is impressive. I can go a full day with moderate use without needing to recharge.

That said, they’re not without flaws. The fit isn’t the most secure for me—if I’m running or moving around a lot, I’m constantly readjusting them to keep them from falling out. Also, while the sound is good, it’s not exactly mind-blowing, especially for the price.

If you’re looking for convenience and decent performance, these are a great choice. Just don’t expect them to replace high-end headphones if you’re an audiophile. Tip: Keep the case clean—it’s a magnet for dust and lint!","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024"

 Very practical","Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.

Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.

Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's "universal" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.

Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.

Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.

AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.

AppleCare tips:
You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.

You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.

You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.

Using AirPods with Android:

Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.

If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find "AirPods" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.

FAIR WARNING:

You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.

I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called "AirPopUp". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.

For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.

Galaxy Buds features:
Made by Samsung
Audio powered by AKG
Rubber ear bud tips
Pair with Samsung device to get the most
Wireless charging case
Active noise cancellation
Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)
Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.

I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled "Galaxy Wearable". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.

Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2023"

 I can't live without these. And I mean that.","I literally have nothing negative to say. I'm a teenager who makes minimum wage and don't regret a single dollar I spent. I dropped one AirPod in a sink of soapy water, and it still works. The sound quality is AMAZING, and it gets very quiet and very loud as well. I can be in a silent room and still have it playing super quietly in the background. It easily and quickly connects and disconnects from all my devices, they never fall out of my ears (unless something touches/moves them like a jacket hood) and don't take very long to charge. I usually only have to charge them every couple of days and I keep them in for hourssss. BUY THEM.

The only negative (which I just thought of now) is that sometimes the location won't load when they're disconnected and you try to ping them. It just says "connecting" and never goes through. Thankfully, I've been able to find them every time, but don't depend on the ability to track them to be able to find them if they're lost. Sometimes the location will come through but it'll be a couple of hours old. What I do like is that you can pick which AirPod to ping, or both (although you can't track/ping the case) and it pings pretty loudly!","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025"

    Decent value","I purchased my AirPods in February of 2022 and thought I would do an update after 3 years of use. I use my AirPods everyday while working, at the gym, or on walks.When I first started using them in 2022, the AirPods battery life would last roughly 5.5 hours and the charging case could charge them roughly 5-6 times before it would also need to be charged.I paid $99 for them on sale as a full disclosure.Fast forward 3 years and the AirPods and case have both seemingly lost over 50% of their battery life.My AirPods only last about 2 hours before dying nowadays and the charging case can only charge them roughly 3 times before it needs to be charged.I still use them while working or at the gym, but can no longer use them while on walks as the battery dies too fast.$99 value makes me feel like I got my moneys worth but I do wish there was a bit more longevity.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

    First Airpods!","These were my first Airpods, and I loved them until I went Pro. It's definitely a good starter for the price range. The battery lifespan seems pretty short (few hours) and the left pod dies quicker than the right one (usually associated with an annoying static noise when it dies out). I was considering getting a second one for that reason until I got the Pro for free through a raffle. I prefer the tapping function with these pods though, and they're less likely to fall out of my ears in comparison to the Pro. If you're looking for noise-cancellation, I recommend going with Pro instead.Honestly, I'm also just writing this review to show off my No face case lol","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

So you have to stay fairly close to your phone and case so there is no disconnection. They work perfectly otherwise, and are very nicely designed.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    Great Wireless Earbuds, But Fit May Not Be for Everyone","Even Apple seems to be embracing the overly long, keyword-packed product titles these days, but the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) live up to the hype for the most part. I originally bought these for my wife, who has no Apple products but loves the fit of Apple’s wired EarPods. These wireless AirPods fit the same, but for some reason, she found them uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.Ultimately, I passed them on to my son, who uses them with his Pixel 6a and an Asus laptop running Windows 11. He hasn’t experienced any issues, and they’ve been working flawlessly. The sound quality is excellent, the battery life is impressive, and the seamless connection is everything you’d expect from an Apple product—even when paired with non-Apple devices. Plus, the absence of rubber ear tips is a nice bonus for those who dislike them.While the fit wasn’t ideal for my wife, these AirPods have been perfect for my son. If the standard Apple EarPod shape works for you, these are a great option for wireless listening. Highly recommended—just keep in mind that fit can vary by person.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2024"

    Last long","I bought these September 2022. I lost one the left AirPod about a year ago, and the right one works just fine. Sometimes it doesn’t connect right away and you have to open the case to connect. Also it’s not loud, so in a loud place you won’t be able to hear, but that’s good so you won’t loose hearing.

    Good, But Durability Issues and Auto-Switching Are Frustrating","I’ve been using the Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) for a many years now. I've had 4 pair. (1 was lost and 2 were replaced due to faulty microphones.)I dislike the newer version with the easy-to-displace silicone tips. While the 2nd Gen offer great convenience and decent sound quality, they come with some very frustrating flaws. The seamless pairing with Apple devices is nice, and they’re comfortable for extended wear. The battery life has held up well, and the charging case is compact and easy to carry.However, the microphone durability is a major issue. After a few months of use, the microphones started failing, making calls difficult. I’ve had to take them to Apple multiple times for replacement under the 1-year warranty, which is great, but it’s still a hassle. For a premium product, I expected better longevity. Another big downside is the lack of a Bluetooth locator for the case—the AirPods themselves can be tracked, but if you misplace the case, you’re out of luck.The most annoying issue, though, is the automatic switching between devices. If I’m watching something on my laptop or TV via Bluetooth and an alarm or notification goes off on my iPhone or Apple Watch, the AirPods immediately switch to the alarm instead of staying connected to what I was originally listening to. It’s incredibly frustrating to constantly have to reconnect them manually. For the price, I expected more control over this feature. Overall, they’re decent, but these flaws make them far from perfect.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025"

    Amazing Upgrade – Worth Every Penny!","I recently upgraded to the AirPods Pro 2, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! These earbuds are a significant improvement over the original AirPods Pro, and here's why they deserve five stars:**Exceptional Sound Quality:** The sound quality on the AirPods Pro 2 is phenomenal. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced across all frequencies. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, everything sounds fantastic.**Superior Noise Cancellation:** The noise cancellation on these is next level. They effectively block out background noise, making my commute and work environment much more pleasant. The transparency mode is also improved, allowing me to hear my surroundings clearly when needed.**Comfortable Fit:** The redesigned ear tips and overall fit are incredibly comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, and they stay securely in place during workouts and runs.**Long Battery Life:** The battery life has seen a noticeable upgrade. I can use them throughout the day with no worries about running out of charge. The quick charge feature is also a lifesaver for those times when I forget to charge them overnight.**Seamless Connectivity:** As expected from Apple, the connectivity is seamless. Pairing them with my iPhone and other Apple devices is effortless, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.**Sleek Design:** The design of the AirPods Pro 2 is sleek and stylish. The case is compact and easy to carry around, and the earbuds themselves look great.**Enhanced Features:** The new features like spatial audio and adaptive EQ make a noticeable difference in the listening experience. It feels like the sound is coming from all around me, providing an immersive experience.Overall, the AirPods Pro 2 is a fantastic upgrade that has exceeded my expectations in every way. They offer excellent sound quality, superb noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit, making them worth every penny. Highly recommended for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience!---I hope this review meets your needs!

    Purchased these in Nov 2019 & still going strong","I bought my 2nd gen Airpods back in 2019 and never expected for them to last this long. (In fact, I was a skeptic when Apple first announced how these things would stay in your ears.) Sounds quality hasn't diminished over time. It picks up ambient sound pretty well, sometimes making it hard for the caller to hear you. Sometimes it has a muted sound and the caller will say you sound muffled. So it's not perfect as a mic device but functions well enough most of the time that it's not a problem. Audio quality to me is great. Never have an issue with sound, music, or hearing a caller. They're not really noise-canceling, so if you're looking for that, you'll be disappointed. However, I've found that if I up the volume, it will drown out loud sounds. I don't like my volume extremely loud since I like to be able to hear what's going on around me, but for trains or large trucks rumbling by, the volume is excellent and still retains good quality. (Not that distortion sound that comes with playing music too loud.)Overall, I'd recommend. I've had this for nearly 5 years (bought it for myself as a Black Friday gift!), and I don't regret it. I see no need to upgrade to a Pro. Audiophiles may want surround sound type thing, in which I'd recommend a Pro, but 2nd gen works well enough for me (until prices drop for some of the newer ones).","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024"

    IT’S REAL AIRPODS FROM APPLE","After reading all the good reviews on here I decided to purchase the AirPods as well. These AirPods are for sure the real thing… if you’re worried that the AirPods are not authentic apple AirPods don’t be worried. It is Authentic! I even called Apple support to confirm my apple care for the AirPods and apple customer support verified it, All you have to do is give them the serial number, date of purchase and receipt. Keep in mind if you purchase the AirPods with Apple care, APPLE replaces the AirPods only if it’s damaged. You send them the damaged AirPod right or left OR Both and they send you a replacement…it does not cover the AirPods if it’s lost or stolen. Sound quality is Great and the cost of the AirPods is worth it. Also, it was fast shipping as well. The only bad thing I would say is the battery dies quick and I have to charge it every few hours. But I Give the Apple AirPods a 10/10","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024"

    Improved Over 1st Gen (regardless of what some here are saying)","Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen.  This is misleading and inaccurate.  Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement.  The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing.  This isn’t anecdotal.  It’s been tested and proven to be faster.Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you’ll save a few dollars.If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade.  If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these.","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2019"

    Good for work.","These AirPods are great I really like them. They get really loud and are good for when you just want to listen to music and be in your own space you can’t hear any background noise when it’s loud and you can leave your phone somewhere else and listen to what’s going on. If you double tap the side there are many things you can set it up to do. It doesn’t take long to charge the case and then case will charge you ear buds 2-3 times before dying again. These stay charged all throughout my 5 hours at work and I only wear one at a time so if one does I can use the other. I wish that they were easier to clean but it isn’t a big problem. They are good for the price. Sometimes they will fall out it depends on your ears but so far mine haven’t had any damage from being dropped.","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024"

    Almost seamless integration","I'm cheap. This was in large part why I resisted shelling out the money for these. Consequently, I tried several other Bluetooth earbuds, several on the decidedly cheap end of the scale. One of the problems I experience is finding earbuds that fit my ears. I have very small ear canals, so the earbuds that have the cone shape tip that fits into the ear canal either just won't fit, or are extremely painful after a short time. The only shape I've found that actually works for me are these, which I discovered with the first pair of wired Apple earbuds that came with a new iPhone several versions back.I included this picture, which shows the Airpods on the left and the much cheaper knock-off I tried. I thought I'd be okay with the shape of the cheap ones, but as you can see, they are actually much larger than the Airpods, so they were frequently falling out of my ears, especially when I was doing any physical activity.So, I bit the bullet and shelled out for the OGs. Here's my take:Pros:-Integration with other Apple products. I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple watch and these work quite seamlessly unlike any others I've tried. I put "almost" in the title because I'm sure it will be improved on in further versions, I'm just not sure how. Oh, and I've never used "Hey Siri" as much as I do with these. I love being able to adjust the volume (among other commands) hands free. True story: Yesterday I was riding a scooter home from work, and not wanting to remove either hand from the handlebars, I wanted to use Siri to increase the volume. There was enough ambient downtown noise that Siri was having trouble hearing me, so as I was tootling down the busy city street I was saying "Hey Siri" repeatedly at increasing volume, until I was shouting it. Not one of my finer moments...-The fit (see above)-Quick charging. I will have something to say about the battery life in Cons, but one saving grace is that they charge remarkably fast. I do a lot of work from my computer (like a lot of others during the time of COVID), so I appreciate being able to get a quick charge on them between meetings.-Sound quality. I am not an audiophile, so my opinion here is very pedestrian, but they seem to have a good dynamic range. I've been blown away by the bass response coming out of such a small thing.Cons:-They still are not very secure in my ears. I suppose that could be more my issue than the Airpods, but I did have to buy an aftermarket accessory kit that included the silicone tips with wings and a silicone lanyard. Sometimes I commute to work on an electric scooter, and if it weren't for those (particularly the lanyard) I would have dropped one of them in the street multiple times. Sometimes I walk over a grate in the street and have a brief moment of fear that one will pop out of my ear and through the grate. With my luck, it isn't so much an issue of "if", but "when". (Side Note: if Apple doesn't sell replacements individually, they should)-Battery life. I figure I get about 2 hours of active use, which is fine and I think what they advertise. The curious thing is that the two discharge at very different rates. I'm trying to keep track so I can take them into our local Apple store and ask about it, but it is odd, and I have seen other reviews that also noted that issue.Overall, I give them 2 thumbs up!","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2020"

    These really made me wish I hadn't wasted time and money with other brands","THE SHORT REVIEW -If you are in the Apple universe, get these.Don't bother wasting your time and money getting non-Apple pods. I already did that for you.THE LONGER REVIEW -I've had three other brands - two of them, very reputable ones - and had issues with all of them, ranging from connectivity to sound quality. The biggest issue was with phone calls which sounded fine to me, but, judging from the complaints, not so much for those on the other end of the calls.Soooo, I finally bit the bullet on Prime Day and got real AirPods. The minute I put them in, I could see and hear that there was no comparison.WHY ARE THESE SO MUCH BETTER?— The sound quality is noticeably superior and connectivity is a dream.— The battery life is great and you can see how much power each pod has.— The case is the charger and it holds a charge for a very long time after it is unplugged. You can pop the AirPods into it and they recharge without having to be connected to anything.— You can use Apple's "Find My..." app to locate them if you misplace them. The Find My app locates the case, not the pods, so I now keep the case in my pocket or purse when wearing the pods. That way, when I take them out, I can put them in the case so that when I put the case down, it can be found wherever I've left it.— You can choose to have Siri announce incoming calls and ask whether or not you want to answer each one. Every time I get a call, I think about how much I love that feature.— Siri also reads to you the Messages that you get while wearing the pods.— Using AirPods is generally intuitive, but do read the instructions to know what and how to tap to activate different functions.One little glitch is that, sometimes when I'm listening to music through the AirPods, I'll say something to my husband and Siri will think I'm talking to her and butt in. It's a little annoying, but anyone who has a device with an "assistant" knows that that is part of the deal.I got this version because my son has had them since they debuted and loves them. I saw no reason to pay more for features I probably wouldn't use. I love them... and I mean LOVE them.I cannot say how they work with non-Apple products because I only have Apple.THE BOTTOM LINE:As I stated at the beginning of this review, get these. They have been worth every penny.Don't waste your time and money getting non-Apple pods. I already did that for you.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021"

 Worth every dollar, Apple quality.","Best product i've purchased in a long time. These headphones are incredible quality and sound. Comfortable and great looking too. The battery life is very impressive also, only need to charge maybe once a week and I use these a lot. These also have removable cushions which make it very easy to clean so they don't smell after sweating in them. Perfect for the gym also. The noise cancelling shuts out virtually all sound other than your music, and the headphones connect almost instantly as soon as you take them out of the case.

 Another amazing Apple Product","As someone who has been using Apple products for over a decade, I have always admired their quality and innovation, and the AirPods Max headphones are no exception to this. While I’ve relied on AirPod Pros for most of my everyday needs, I’ve found that I absolutely love the AirPods Max even more for a variety of reasons.

First and foremost, the comfort level of these headphones is truly remarkable. They fit comfortably on my head, even during extended listening sessions, thanks to the well-padded ear cups and adjustable headband. This level of comfort makes them perfect for long hours of use, whether I’m working, traveling, or just relaxing at home.

The design of the AirPods Max is not only stylish but also incredibly practical. They’re easy to store, and the folding mechanism helps protect them when not in use. The connection process is seamless; they pair effortlessly with all my Apple devices, ensuring a hassle-free experience every time I put them on.

One minor drawback is the battery life, which, while decent, isn’t the absolute best compared to some other high-end headphones. However, it still manages to last through most of my daily activities, and the quick charge feature is a helpful addition.

Maintaining these headphones is straightforward as well. The materials are easy to clean, allowing me to keep them looking pristine with minimal effort. Plus, they look fantastic when worn, adding a sleek and modern touch to my appearance.

The sound quality is where the AirPods Max truly shines. The audio experience is top-notch—rich, clear, and immersive. The noise-cancelling feature works exceptionally well, providing an impressive level of isolation from external noises. Whether I’m at the gym, on an airplane, or lounging on the couch, the AirPods Max deliver a superb listening experience.

Overall, I highly recommend the Apple AirPods Max headphones to anyone looking for superior sound quality, excellent noise-cancelling capabilities, and exceptional comfort. They’ve quickly become my go-to choice for a premium audio experience, and they’re well worth the investment. If you’re in the market for high-quality headphones, the AirPods Max will not disappoint.","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024"

 Amazing Cancellation on Long Haul Flights! I was hesitant to pay $$, but glad I did","Disclosures: I am immersed in the apple ecosystem. I am not compensated for my reviews in any way.

SUMMARY: Apple Airpods Max were not my first choice because of their relatively high price. I purchased from and returned to amazon a pair of new B*se QC headphones and replaced them with apple Airpods Max after three days. I have now travelled overseas with them and I am very impressed; in fact, I absolutely love them. They are the workhorse among fluffy, cheap plastic competing headphones. Solid performance during punishing overseas flights and ground travel.

PRO: ** Sound quality was superb and far superior to the competing product that I returned to amazon. ** I fully charged the Airpods Max to 100% and without recharging them, watched several full length movies and streamed live and saved music nonstop; they held their charge for well over 21 hours, when my flight reached its final destination, they were at 0%, but were still cancelling noise and performing almost 23 hours later. ** Quality Construction, look and feel, ** Analog Volume and sound mode controls are easier to find and use than the features on the pair I returned, ** Comfort & Fit on large heads – I have a large head and cannot feel the 13.6 ounces of weight, however, my petite wife found them to be too heavy for her pretty little head. ** At first, I hated, now I LOVE the protective “bra” case because easily went in and out of my carry-on laptop bag 100x without taking up coveted real estate inside… it now makes sense to me. ** Many very inexpensive after-market silicon covers are available to protect areas of the device that the “bra” does not cover, including the mesh headband. ** I tested the Noise Cancellation feature on two, 10 hour overseas flights and four, 3 hour domestic flights over a two week period. My previous headphones did a nice job of cancelling airplane noise, the Airpods Max were even better—much better because almost completely neutralized almost all ambient aircraft noise; I slept on the airplane feeling like I was not wedged in among 300+ other people. ** The 8 microphones comprising the sound “transparency” feature did a very nice job of allowing me to hear airport/airplane announcements, while still warding off, whie still giving unwanted chit-chatters a sense that I could not hear them.**

CON:

**As noted, the Price seems high at first, but my field test of Airpods Max during my recent marathon overseas trips proved to me that spending an extra $150-$200 (I found a better price on amazon than at apple store) was worth every penny. No buyer’s remorse here. **Charging to 100% is not quick; give yourself overnight. **If you have a small head or a weak neck, the weight of Airpods Max might bother you, but if you don’t and you’re looking for a sturdy, stainless steel framed, (aluminum earcups) work horse with amazing technology, buy these. **I purchased apple’s proprietary cord to connect with the airline’s onboard entertainment system…it worked fine, but shame on apple for charging so much for a cable, which should be about 10 to 12 inches longer.","Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2024"

 Excellent headphones, made in the typical "first draft" Apple way","Full disclosure: I purchased these headphones back in April 2021 and gave them some break-in time (until June 2021) before I reviewed them, so this is my experience of having them for more than 90 Days.

I owned a pair of Beats Studio Wireless 2's for about 4 years, and they were a useable set of cans. They had some pretty smart wired connections, good battery life, and were rather comfy to wear... but their wireless connections were a nightmare, the integrated Mic awful, and the noise-canceling mediocre. I was looking for a change, and being a consumer of Apple Products and with the generally good reviews I had seen for the Airpod Max, I decided to take the (kind of) expensive plunge. And honestly, I was not disappointed.

As with any good review, we'll break it down into the Pros & Cons and explore both.

BUILD QUALITY/DESIGN

PROS:

The build quality on these headphones is nothing short of phenomenal. They are made of Metal and some nylon or rubber here and there (for the headband and earcup padding) and they feel VERY SOLID. The piston style adjustments on the headband always feel super tight and mechanical (still even months after using them). The earcups are always tight on my head, allowing the headphones to clamp down on my ears and prevent noise leakage. The Earcups are built out of what looks to be a rubberized polycarbonate and padded mesh fabric and are held in by MAGNETS, making them easy to replace if they get soiled or if you want a different color.

Also, found out after the fact, the headband is ALSO replaceable if you want a different color later on down the line. The metal the speaker boxes are made from are the standard matte Apple aluminum, and the control buttons on the right speaker box are on par with the dials and buttons included on their Apple Watches (in fact, I'm pretty sure they're the same buttons, just "upsized" in the CAD program when making this device). It all feels very expensive and well built, and even 100+ days after initial use, still feels "brand new" and solid.

CONS:

Whereas I love the build quality, there are some pretty glaring design flaws and comfort issues that come along with this first outing from Apple.

First, whereas the headphones still fit like they were brand new, I'd hope for some relief on the hard clamping aspect present in them. When I first wore them, I was finding the clamping done by the headphones very tight and threatening to give me a headache if I wore them too long since it was like a vise on my head. This has lessened slightly over time, but it is still very tight. I don't know of a fix for this outside of constant wear to try and get them to bend a flex to a less tight shape on my dome, but so far they still hurt a bit when wearing them for an extended time.

Second, even though I like the good piston mechanics on the ear height adjustment with the headband since it takes some force to properly adjust them, sometimes you have to grip on the speaker boxes and pull downwards on them while pushing upwards on the headband with your cranium to get them to adjust to your liking. This wouldn't be an issue if the dial and button were on the bottom of the headphones, but since they're on the top of the right speaker box, it is notoriously difficult to adjust them on your head and not accidentally press one of the buttons, causing playback or the headphones to go into pair mode (which happens if you hold down the buttons for too long). You'd think, "oh, just grab the sides of the speaker boxes", which makes sense, however as I stated they are made of Apple's standard aluminum, and to add to that the edges are very rounded, so getting a grip on the side of the headphone speaker boxes is difficult at best.

SOUND

PROS: The sound quality on these is an absolute beast, and it's by far the best pair of headphones I've ever used. The audio is clear, and you can hear highs, lows, and everything in between. However, I will be the first to admit, while I am musically inclined and love listening to audio, I'm by no means an Audiophile or claim to be able to hear what types of sounds are being emitted cleanly and loudly, and which aren't. I usually can if I have good reference, but as these are the best headphones I've ever owned, so they become the new baseline. Also, the built in noise canceling is the best in the business right now, and is definitely better than its closest competitor. The reason why it is so good is due to the multiple microphones established in the soundbox housing, which not only work EXTREMELY well for the ANC, but also for phone calls. The phone calls made from these headphones are nearly studio mic grade in how they sound, and are much better than most things included on computers or competitor headphones nowadays.

CONS: Though I am not an audiophile, there is something that I can tell— when there is killer bass and when there isn't. And to my ears, these don't have a superheavy bass that will rattle your fillings, which is *fine*, but I thought there would simply be *more* bass in the audio. The bass may be enough for most music, and what it has is ok, but nothing akin to the huge bass I was *expecting*. The nice thing is that if you delve into the Accessibility Settings for your Apple product, you can set an audio profile for the headphones so it'll enhance the audio based on how well you hear (so already, this enhancement is *proprietary*; not a big deal for me as I own nothing but Apple devices, but YMMV).

EASE OF USE/ACCESSORIES

PROS: If using Apple products, the handoff of the headphones to the other devices works really, really well and hasn't needed to be paired more than once to each device it is used on. The pairing process is nicely simple if it does go wonky, and doesn't have nearly as many issues as other BT that gets locked into a single device. The equipment/accessories that it comes with are acceptable (charging lightning cable, bra-esque "case"). The stop/start/volume dial is very responsive and easy to click using the same click sequence that Airpod Pros have used for a while (Double click to advance, triple-click to go back, quad click, etc...). If you take them off your head, the headphones have a similar light sensor that other Airpods have to determine if they're in your ears or not, and will halt the music accordingly or start playing if they recognize they're back in place on your head. The lightning cable to charge the headphones is embedded in the base of the right-hand speaker box, and charges using the same style cable that your iPhone and old Airpods do, so you should already have at least one cable for it if you own Apple products.

CONS: Hooo boy, ok. So with any early adopter technology, there's always going to be some bugs that need working out, or some design flaw that (where not crippling) makes the headphones more of a chore and less fun to use. This may be our longest section, but please take these with a grain of salt— none of these are dealbreakers for *me*, but since I'm not you, YMMV. Here are the issues I found in no particular order, but NEED to be discussed as I've often seen them glossed over elsewhere—

- Analogue Connection. There is no direct analogue connection with these headphones. As most audiophioles claim, digital (especially wireless digital) will never be an acceptable connection replacement for analogue. And most high-grade cans have some sort of analog 3.5mm jack that can be plugged into a normal headphone port that will allow you to use these headphones with devices that don't transmit via BT, like a Record Player, or high-end sound system. The Airpods Max unfortunately have no such analogue connection. "But!" you may exclaim, "You can always use the Lightning port and plugin a Lightning to 3.5mm converter cable!" This is true... to an extent. First off, to get that feature to work, you need to get a SPECIFIC cable— Apple's Lighting to 3.5mm cable. The reason? Because that cable, and seemingly ONLY that cable, is BI-DIRECTIONAL. This means that no matter what end you plug your source into, that cable will translate the audio both ways. Most to all third-party cables (that I was able to find in my research) are like an annoying 13-year-old listening to music in 2011: all they play is ONE DIRECTION. Also, to top off the annoyance, when you DO use the Apple Cable, it takes the analogue source, transfers it to the headphones, whose signal is then converted to digital. Automatically, mandatorily, every time. This may be a problem for some people who demand their Analogue output to be heard in its original analogue glory. Also, the Apple cable that you HAVE to use is super cheap feeling and thin, instead of the normal thick or braided casing most headphone cables use. Did I mention that Apple also DOES NOT include this cable with the headphones? It's extra. Like about $30-$40 extra. So you may be better off with another set of headphones if you want a good, wired, analogue signal.

- The "Case". I feel like the case that is included with these headphones will go down in history alongside the 1998 iMac USB Puck mouse, the Apple Newton, and the Magic Mouse Lightning port as one of their more GLORIOUSLY STUPID design decisions. The "case" is made of what I can assume is leather, but for a set of ~$550 headphones, that's about the only "premium" feature they boast. There is minimal padding. There supposedly is a magnet included in the area where the headphone edges touch that triggers an internal reed switch to put the cans in standby mode. Half the "case" is exposed to the elements and doesn't fully cover the electronics, so it isn't ideal as something to protect from inclement weather. And lastly, and most egregious, is that there is no way to use the case to carry around the headphones or attach them to anything— no belt clip or loop, no hanging clip, nothing. So believe me when I say that you're gonna need a case for these things if they're ever gonna leave your home, and it's almost imperative if you live in a place with inclement weather. I bought a full zip case that has a built-in magnet for the reed switch, has a few pockets for cables, and is very padded. It was worth the cost to make sure that my headphones that cost *half a thousand dollars* stay safe. Apple's lack of protection has not only garnered users' ire, but made the Airpod Max case into little more than a joke, and I really can't see a counterargument to either of those things.

- Lack of Lossless audio on their own products. So as many know, Apple has just announced that it will have lossless audio on its Apple Music platform soon, which is a boon to audiophiles everywhere. But in everything I have read about it, they always have the caveat that the lossless audio currently doesn't work with the Airpod Max headphones. Even if you buy the bi-directional cable from Apple. And there has been no "we plan to support it soon" soundbite, or "we will be updating the Airpod Max firmware to be compatible in XXX of 202X". So, if that is super important for you, just know it may not be supported on this model of Airpods Max, possibly at all (Apple is notorious in doing this, and will just release it in the next version). So if it is released eventually, I wouldn't expect it on this model, and you'll have to plunk down another half a thousand bucks to get a set that will work with the feature.

WRAP UP/FINAL THOUGHTS

In the end, I'm really pleased with these headphones. They are some of the finest pieces of audio equipment that I have ever owned, and I love all the premium features they included. Certain areas leave something to be desired on them, but they are niggling feature issues or design kinks that will be worked out later. I am hopeful that these headphones will stay the same for a few revisions and the firmware/software will evolve to support more features, as well as the accessories (and third-party solutions) to be able to work more universally with non-Apple products or be more robust in their construction. To be fair, for a first draft Apple product, they are the accessory that I've had the least amount hassle with.

All in all, I highly enjoy and recommend these headphones, and if you are an Apple Fan and budding audiophile, I believe you will too. Let's just hope that Apple keeps improving these models to make them feel like they were worth the ~$550 price point.","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2021"

 Great over-ear headphones - but ears get warm after wearing for more than 30 min","Can't say it any simpler - it's an Apple product. It looks great, sounds great, link very easily to my other Apple products. Yes, they are expensive but I anticipate that the materials used will last for years. The noise cancellation is spooky good - and very handy on planes. Only shortcoming is that after 30-40 minutes of wearing, my ears do get warm; but I think that is the same for all over-ear headphones. For me I can deal with warmth, in contrast to the discomfort of on-ear headphones on long flights or extended wear. I have worn them for a few workouts, but honestly, when you lay on a bench, they tend to slide off. even when I adjust the headband to fit snugly. Therefore, I don't recommend them for gym wear especially if doing free weights or machines that you are not vertical. I purchased the light silver pods with white headband, which is great for a person like me who wants a minimalist look. Would buy again, but wait for good sale.

    Here’s what you need to know.","Just a little disclaimer I’m not an audiophile.Noise cancelling is great in fact This works really well, almost too well, for someone who is a college student and is stuck in a study lounge with a bunch of other students gossiping and being loud, just throw these bad boys on and they are gone! Or if you want to gossip with them but don’t feel like taking off your headphones, the transparency mode is this really cool pass through sound, with such detail that it’s like you took off the headphones, it’s actually my favorite part and I leave this on majority of the time. You can also turn off either of these modes.These headphones are very heavy as it’s made out of quality materials. I’ve seen headphones quadruple the price point and they were NOT made out of materials this nice. It just looks like a premium product to me.Unfortunately, the case is…. Horrendous, I’ve literally couldn’t fit it in my bag one time and I had to carry it and it was like a mini purse. If I were to drop it down on the ground, it probably would’ve demolished the whole headphone. There’s really no way around this either because there is no way to turn off the headphone without putting it inside this bra… I mean case.Battery life is great. To be honest I don’t use my headphones very often, but they hold their charge very well. I probably charge it every 2 weeks.Sound quality is great, especially with songs supporting Dolby atmos.I would definitely explore your other options first. These are getting quite old and Apple is releasing newer ones.I’ve also heard issues of condensation from your EARS getting inside the actual headphones itself, yes the INSIDE of the headphones where the components are and Apple says it is not even the slightest bit splash resident or waterproof.I was curious, wore this for 15 minutes getting a small quiz done. Took the ear cap off and the ENTIRE inside of the ear cup was SOAKED. and I wasn’t even sweaty or anything. I’ve had people on Reddit or other reviewers say this completely broke their headphones and when they went to get it fixed, Apple told them it was their fault.","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024"

    A very expensive pair of bluetooth headphones that won't break so easily.","I've been through multiple pairs of bluetooth, DJ orientated, and even audio headphones over the years, and for the consumer grade they still are, they're one of the few bluetooth headsets that have metal hinges. Finally! I only had to spend 500 bucks, but they won't snap at the hinge like so many pairs of Sony, Technics, and a few other brands not worth mentioning! This right there is almost worth the cost considering the plastic brands are more or less disposable over the years.The sound quality is good enough. Not overly bass heavy like Beats. Not 500 dollar wired headphones hooked up to a nice amplifier playing records of an analog mixing desk, but good. I'm going to guess if you expect that level of sound quality a bluetooth protocol that you're a lost hope in the first place.My real problem is that as you wear the headset, the ear pads and the headband will start to discolor from your skin oils, and if you wear the headset as often as I do (I use it to block out a partner who has a chainsaw in her head at night), the earpads will start to stink. The pads are removable and replaceable (at 70 dollars a set!), but they stain pretty quickly. I bought the silver units and wish I got the space grey. Be aware of this if you plan to use them for sleeping purposes.Not much else on the market really matches. I wish Sony/Technics/etc would get the memo.","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024"

    Great sound but easily scratched","These are great headphones. Overall, the aesthetic is very clean and you look cool wearing them. Weight wise, they are lighter than you'd think for metal based over-ear headphones. I've worn them for hours and they don't get uncomfortable in the way that some headphones can after long periods. The noise cancelation is fantastic and so it the audio feedback when you listen to music. The quality of sound is clear. An added perk is that if you have other apple products, the compatibility and connectivity is seamless.  You can bounce between different apple products without any issue.Very happy with the purchase. I will say, if you want quality headphones, you definitely don't have to go with this pricetag. However, if you do, you won't regret it.  Only negative is that they don't come with outside ear covers. So be careful about scratching them.","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024"

    *UPDATE* COMPARISON TO MX4","so i got a chance to try sony mx4 ($350) for a bit so this is my new review:- airpods max noise cancelling is better- the transparency on the airpods max sounds AMAZING compared to the mx4 (its really bad)- sound quality on max is better- airpods max feels really solid compared to the plastic mx4. HOWEVER, the mx4 being able to fold into a very compact case was convenient- the mx4 is more comfortable for me but lowkey doesn't feel clamped enough (but i also have a small head)- also something that i didnt realize was so important: the compatibility with apple devices!! I was trying to share audio with a pair of airpod pros and the mx4 but it wouldnt work. also the ease of being able to change settings of the max without a separate app is nice- i like the buttons to change volume/switch between modes/skip songs on the max. the mx4 has a feature where you just swipe the side of the headphone instead of pressing buttons and its annoying because it either doesnt work or it accidentally presses when im trying to adjust the headphones- also i like the beep it makes when switching between transparency/noisecancelling on the max. the mx4 has an actual voice that says "ambient sound on" which gets annoying- also the customization choices on the max are better (more color options, lots of cases)-also i found a less itchy ear pad thing (protein leather) for the airpod max for about $40! woohoo- the airpods max still slide a bit but as long as i keep my head upright its fine--- --- --- ---‼️ORIGINAL REVIEW:‼️⬇️original rating: ⭐️⭐️I regret buying these. I could've bought headphones that are just as good, or probably even better, for half the price.Pros:- noise cancelling is pretty good (but honestly I think the airpods pros might be better or around the same)- very customizable lol like theres nice cases for it and stuff which is partially why I got it- sound quality is good but idk about $500 goodcons:- slides off my head really easily- makes my jaw really sore because of how tight it is (also since it's around my jaw, eating with them on is really uncomfortable)- The ear pads are kind of itchy- the ear parts just don't fit my head right, like they are just too big i guess, so there's gaps which ruins the noise cancelling a bit- the "case" it comes in (can you even call it a case??) offers essentially no protection (but I found another hard case on amazon for around $30 which I like so far)***On the other hand, my boyfriend has these airpods max and LOVES them so it's really just personal preference. I had tried them on in the apple store (before I bought some) and they seemed comfortable but I guess wearing it for longer periods of times made me realize that they're just not the right ones for me. Unfortunately, I cannot return them anymore but I will update if I figure out ways to make them more comfortable","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023"

    On the fence...","As an undergraduate studying corporate finance and legal studies with a pursuit in media relations. A good pair of headphones is crucial. I am a huge Apple fan and use their hardware daily to complete my tasks and effectively manage my colligate workload. Of course, I bought these headphones for the audio ability, but they just look great!I ran into a few issues after a few days of use. The AirPods Max struggles to connect to my computer. I use many devices at once and this cross-connection is an important aspect while finding which headphones to make one's daily driver. I know other brands are less expensive but are far more capable of what the Max headphones can do.I know amazon has an amazing return policy when it comes to technology. I will be trying other brands to see whats the best fit!","Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2024"

I was hesitant of getting these due to the price, but I was able to get them during the Prime Days in 2024.I like the headphones and the case.I was disappointed that they did not come with a charging block.  For this price, I would expect it to include that.  I was also surprised that this came with the lightening charger.  I have an iPad with the USB C connection.  I thought that all products would be updated to that type of charging cord.  I am able to use my airpods charger or switch out my iPad charger with the one that came with these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024"

    Overall good headphones, with a  review of dolby atmos mixes","I was asked to evaluate these by a friend. The design is typical Apple. The sound quality is excellent. Ample bass, pleasant to listen to. I work in music production, so i have a good baseline of experience with headphones of all different kinds. The noise cancelling, is probably the best I've ever heard. I'm not usually a fan of noise cancelling, except for plane flights, but these are exceptional in that regard.Things I don't like:The headband has a very thin spandex type material that I'm positive will get torn the moment any mishap takes place. It's unnecessary to the design. Dumb.No way to plug in for wired use, except for the apple charge to mini jack converter. Dumb.If I didn't already have some bluetooth headphones that are really decent, I may have kept these.After all, these are "spatial audio enabled"! Whaaaaaaa???? What does that mean?Well, let's talk about that. I'm an audio professional and am interested in Dolby Atmos, which is now offered in Apple Music. So, when I heard about this, I couldn't throw my money at them fast enough to get these magic headphones that would put me in 3 dimensional music world. The headphones showed up today, and I put them to the test.  Here's what happened.Dolby Atmos Music on Apple AirPods Max headphones - Is it cool?I spent this evaluation time mostly in the Settings menu, switching the Dolby off and on between the lossless, so i could really hear the differences. In almost every case, the vocal was less present, more reverb (and I’m not ever a fan of adding reverb to a vocal that should be dry and in your face), the drums got pushed way back, and the expected surround effect wasn’t enough to win me over. I guess the effect of Atmos (at least in headphones) is similar to hearing the music performed in a live setting. Things are less present, more muted, and swimming in the room. But, I never got a sense of “whoa, it’s behind me” or “it’s above me”. What I got was a less present, mushier, sub-heavy version, that lacked the urgency of the original mix. This was true for mostly everything I heard.The exception for me was the Art Blakey's "Moanin'", which because of the recording (1958), when often the stereo (2 channels or speakers) mixing style of the day involved each instrument hard panned to the left or right speaker, with little or no center position middle ground in the original mixes. The Atmos helps a bit by panning everybody slightly more center. In this case, one could argue, Atmos fixed a “problem”.On most rock mixes, I still prefer the lossless. It sounds like the tendency of a few of these mixers (or maybe this is just what Dolby’s process does) has been to extend low frequency (sub) and push the drums  out of the foreground. This isn’t awesome to me, when a lot of rock music craves in your face urgency. Overall, drums are just way mushier. Maybe this is just an unfortunate sign of early days of a format that's finding its sea legs.listening on a home theater rig might change my mind about how cool Atmos is, but I really draw the line at adding reverb to music. And I know that’s going to be the first thing they reach for. I’m just not down. Call me old, call me cranky, but misplaced verb is stanky.If Atmos for music is going to take off, it’s got to be within consumers’ reach AND it has to be good without being gimmicky.The headphones have already been dropped at UPS for return. For this particular prosumer,'s the whole "spatial thing" is not quite ready for prime time.Best of luck,Skip","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2021"

The sound seems to come from the iPhone, and even if you turn your head, the music seems to be coming from the direction of your iPhone.  Cans are comfortable too, I can wear them the whole day.

    Amazing Noise Cancellation and Surprisingly Durable!","I've had my AirPods Max headphones for over 2 years now, and I've had no issues with them or had signs of heavy battery drain/deterioration. These headphones are amazing for their noise cancellation - they are my go to for when I want to study or work and block out noises. I won't lie and say they are my best headphones as my Sony headphones are better when reviewing from an audiophile's perspective (and cheaper), but this product is amazing for what it does. And as expected it works seamlessly with other apple products being able to switch from my devices based on what it picks up as the priority device (i.e. listening to music on my iPhone then picking up my iPad to watch something on YouTube and the headphones switches the audio connection to the iPad). I also like how customizable it is, and the ease of cleaning or even replacing the ear cushions.

    Meh","I don’t think I qualify as an audiophile but I have owned lots of different headsets and earbuds from many different makers (Bose, Beats, etc.) After having these for a few weeks I give them an average rating. I don’t think the sound quality is all that outstanding. I hear distortion in some of the highs. And yes I tried adjusting equalizer settings. For nearly 500 bucks I’d expect better from any manufacturer and I think Apple is getting away with one here. If these weren’t carrying the Apple logo they’d be worth maybe 200 bucks. I’ve had to use “Forget device” quite a few times to get them to connect on different devices (phone, iPad, MacBook) and that’s pretty frustrating when you’ve handed Apple so much dough. So if you’re in the market, I’d go with the Bose.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    These headphones connect seamlessly between Apple devices uncle my Apple pros. The sound quality is amazing. Love these head phones and when talking on the phone you sound more clear. The noise cancellation works very good and they’re not to heavy at all surprisingly they are very light weight. I hear a lot of people saying they are too tight but they are a comfortable fit and I have a lot of hair and wear a head covering and they feel very nice over the ears. This came with charging cord and the case. Highly recommend these headphonesUPDATE-I have now had these head phones for a couple weeks and they have now the sound has started to go out randomly throughout watching a 10 minute video/or phone call. They sometimes the sound breakups up and lags for a few seconds then goes back to normal. So it’s now not worth the money at all! You can’t listen to anything for 5+ minutes without the sound going in and out or it breaking up and glitching. I have tried to reset them and that hasn’t worked. To be this expensive they should’ve worked for a very long time with no issues and it’s only been 16 days. Waste of money and I can’t return because the window closed on 2/26 I ordered these on 2/7 and received them 2/11. I would NOT recommend these!Update!!

    Great sound and material quality but unfortunately very heavy and uncomfortable","I'm no Apple fanboy, but to keep things simpler I try to keep my technology within a single ecosystem if possible, given how unreliable computers and related technology often are. Apple also has a better than average track record for hardware and industrial design (their software is no better than anyone else's nowadays, IMHO).Anyway, I *really* wanted to like the AirPods Max (too similar a name to their AirPods Pro, so easily confused... dumb). The sound quality is very good and the material quality (mostly metal) is impressive---but along with this comes excessive weight for wearing beyond an hour or so, mostly around the ears, and also too much "clamping" force as is often described. I don't have an abnormally large head and I am fit and relatively healthy. I should be considered a typical user/consumer. I always assumed that Apple did thorough product testing (?). Did they really? In this case, I don't see how they could release this product and keep it as-is for 4+ years given the inherent design flaws. I've now read online that a lot of people have issues with the weight and discomfort these headphones as it turns out. Caveat emptor, I should have researched better before buying them.I hope Apple pays some attention outside their walled garden as to how their products are received and makes improvements commensurate to their process and products. I hope the next version of these headphones are lighter and more ergonomic; if so, then I'll consider getting them---after doing better research first.Also, returning these through Amazon is a royal PITA---not the usual process, because once you activate these headphones they become part of your Apple account, which you have to delete, either before or after contacting Amazon customer service, blah blah blah. Then they send a UPS driver to pick up the return on the next business day, so you have to be home. Lots of hassles and time wasted. I won't buy from Amazon any Apple product that uses telemetry again. Better off going to an Apple Store.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024"

    These Sound Amazing","The sound quality is awesome, loudness is great, but my favorite aspect of these by far is the quality of noise cancelling! Perfect for airplanes, and for work meetings next to noisy neighbors. I found with traditional in-ear AirPods the noise cancelling feature sounds loud -if that makes sense. But these don’t seem to deafen me while cancelling airplane noise, allowing me to play music clearly without having to crank up the volume.

    Wow!  Biggest mistake was not buying sooner.","I put off buying the Pro Max headphones for far too long, having been a Bose QC35 user for many years, but man these things are great.  Granted I can't speak to how they match up to the newer Bose QC 700 but being an Apple person, these headphones tightly integrate into the Apple ecosystem so well.  Perhaps my biggest complaint about the Bose QC headphone line was Bose's sub-optimal app and switching between devices.  The AirPods Max just work with limited user interaction across all Apple devices.I've been using them seamlessly with my iPhone, iPad, Mac Studio, and AppleTV.  The AppleTV experience essentially equates to not needing a high-end surround system (which I also have Bose for).  The acoustics and bass when watching movies is stunning.

    Apple creates the most impeccable headphone","It's not that I'm an Apple affectionado, but when I compare the Apple Airpods Max to almost any other bluetooth or wired headphone, there is no comparison . It's not an audiophile headphone, but will most definitely compete with any other ANC headphone out there. The bass is more than adequate, offering a deep and more than satisfying sub-acoustic representation. When listening to HBO's "The Pacific", or Netflix's "Masters of the Air", the soundstage elicits an immaculate impression of the battlefront. The incredible representation of mortars, sub-machine guns, and crossfire makes you believe you are actually on the front line. Terrifyingly realistic. Mids and high's require absolutely no translation. Completely natural. Yes, they are insanely expensive, especially compared to headphones in the same price category, but if you value absolute clarity and an expansively neutral soundstage, these will more than adequately justify the minuscule investment required to completely immerse yourself in a perfect audiophile's dream environment.","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2024"

    BEST headphones I’ve ever owned! WARNING ⚠️ however","The sound quality on these are freaking amazing between Dolby Vision surround sound for movies, or the thumping bass and spatial audio listening to music, it’s like nothing I’ve literally ever heard. One HUGE problem if you’re similar to myself— Condensation. From even minor ear sweat, these things will not bode well as time wears on. Just check the AirpodMax subReddit. It’s filled with many complaints of disconnecting, no longer working units. I’ve had them 3 weeks and they just stopped working and would no longer connect as of yesterday. I clean the condensation out regularly just to prevent this, but it didn’t matter. Thankfully, this morning I woke up and they must’ve dried out completely and are working again. ☺️ If you still decide to purchase these, GET APPLE CARE!! I use these at my warehouse job and I get minor ear sweat so I made sure to get Apple Care just in case. For $500 it’s a no brainer, especially reading many people on Reddit’s several exchanges.Bottom Line: Absolutely Amazing headphones for CASUAL use. For moderate moving around they’re sustainable if you make sure to monitor the condensation. Thankfully the magnet ear pads make this very easy. You will NOT be able to workout in these or sit in the sun relaxing. You’ve been warned.","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2022"

    I love these headphones!","I don't need these, I wanted these. I already have the Beats New Studio Pro, the Beats Studio Earpods +, the Apple Airpods Pro 2.  But these are iconic and just plain classy. Are they heavy? Yeah. But I still work out in them fine. The sound is superb. The Apple Airpods Max 2 are not coming out anytime soon, and with the new firmware updates they don't need to. Is the case goofy? Yeah. But, with the new firmware you don't have to put them in the case for them to go into sleep mode. I'm not into ANC, so I won't speak to that, but the Transparency Mode is awesome. The overall sound quality is like the Airpods Pro 2, maybe better. The Airpods Pro 2 are way better than the Airpods Pro 1, so please don't think that I am comparing them to those. Even if the Apple Airpods Max 2 came out in a couple of months, I would not regret getting these now. And, I'm glad that I bought them new, and didn't try to save a couple of bucks getting them from the grey market.

    Airpod Max - Worth it? When comparing to Bose, Sony noise cancellation headphones","I'm a user of Airpods Pro and Bose's and Sony's noise cancellation headphones. I went into the Apple store to  try out the Airpod Max and was immediately sold on its build quality, aesthetics and sound.Comparing with other products, the Airpod Max is more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Since the earcups are made of metal, it has a premium feel to it. I got it in the white color and since the head band is fabric, I do have concerns of it wearing and dirtying over time. We shall see.The noise cancellation is better than other comparable products. When you activate it, you don't really feel it like you would other noise cancellation headphones in the $3-400 range. I'm looking forward to trying it on an airplane to test its comfortability.Overall, 4/5 stars - since I haven't been using enough to test its durability and easiness of cleaning. I recommend it even if you already have another noise cancellation headphones since it's really top of the line.","Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2023"

    Good Design, One Important Flaw","The sound quality and noise cancelation are excellent.  They connect to macOS devices easily.  I like their performance and would have gone with 4-5 /5 if not for a significant design choice that makes their use a problem (at least for me).The ear cups are removable (great!) but held in place only with magnets.  If you use headphones often, you know oils and dirt build up on them and so many people use removable cloth covers to keep the hardware clean and reduce irritation.  These covers (I have many different ones) are held in place with an elastic band so they can be easily removed and laundered.That's where the magnets are a problem.  The elastic pulls through the magnets and the cups won't stay on the headset.  Tried a few different ways to attach covers, they all fail because the elastic pull is stronger than the magnetic connection.Directions for cleaning the cups don't indicate they can be laundered.  The suggested cleaning process is laborious and full of disclaimers about their fragility.  Magnets are a neat trick. Apple likes playing with magnetic connections, but I think a latch would have been a better design.Looking forward to the second generation.  This is a solid first effort, but I'm gonna have to return mine.","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024"

    Awesome headphones!","These aren't cheap but they are worth the money! I've owned various pairs of studio and consumer headphones over the years and my Bose are the only cans that come close to these followed by my Sonys. While some people may find them a little big around their ears, they are a perfect fit for me. The noise cancelation is better on the Airpods Max than on any other headphones or earbuds I own or have owned with noise cancelation on board. I can listen to a podcast or a tv show etc while vacuuming the house for example and I don't strain to pick out dialogue or delicate passages of music etc. The sound quality is crisp and clear without being harsh on the high end. I am very happy with these headphones. The one con for me would be battery life. I hope that when they release the next generation of the Airpods Max, they can improve the battery life. Otherwise, these are my favorite headphones hands down.","Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2023"

The sound quality surpassed my expectations when watching shows or listening to music. Everything is crispy and clear! Noise cancellation is great, but do keep in mind that if the environment is really loud, you may still hear a bit of it through the headphones. It doesn't bug me too much and helps brings some peace and quiet when necessary. When first receiving the headphones, wearing them cause a bit of soreness cuz I felt like my head was being squished. After wearing them for long periods of time, you kind of break them in and they will become more comfortable that you don't even notice them. Prior to owning the AirPods Max, I owned that AirPods Pros and they were uncomfortable after a few hours of wears. When comparing the two, the Max is definitely the best overall. Every single day I'll pack them in my bag for work and they've held up! Durability is definitely there, and tbh there's really no need to purchase an extra case since it gets really bulky. I had purchased a case only to never use it unless I feel like it's necessary to be used.

 The best Bluetooth true wireless headphones I've own","I've owned the Bose QC series, Sony WH1000XM3 & M4's, Bowers & Wilkins Px8, Panda. The Apple AirPod Max are the best, in terms of clarity and soundstage, I've tried so far. I also owned a pair of Sennheiser HD 800s - these are wired, but the AirPod Max is the only wireless headphone had even approaches the HD 800 in audio soundstage and overall quality. To note, I do use Apple Music, so I'm sure this only adds to why the AirPod Max's sound so good.
The Max's are a bit hefty, but by design, are well balanced - the result is a solid headphone is quite comfortable (I've worn them on a 9 hour flight with no issues).

 Threes are a step up from other ANC headphones.","With headphones I think sound quality is paramount and these offer excellent sound quality compared to the headphones I’ve tried (Sony xm4,Momentum 4,Beats Studio pro). I’m no audiophile but do enjoy sound and these are really nice. The Spatial Audio is surprisingly good. Not all SA songs sound as good as others but some songs will definitely make you turn your heads to see where the sound is coming from.

The ANC is really good. I haven’t been on an airplane with these but around the house they really shut the noise out.

Transparency mode it’s just like not wearing headphones. Perfect.

Some of the negatives are that they are heavier than other headphones but I this hasn’t been an issue at all. The case is kind of a meme at this point. I use it day to day but did buy a 3rd party case for travel as the Apple case isn’t very protective.

 Critical design flaws make these headphones a dealbreaker for anyone that values their money/time.","Do yourself a favor and pass on these trash headphones. The poor quality headband and “condensation gate” issue should be a dealbreaker enough to pass on these headphones entirely. They are not worth your consideration. The sound quality, ANC, and transparency features are great, but there are critical design flaws that simply cannot be ignored at that $500+ price point.

Google “condensation gate” and you will understand why these headphones don’t deserve your hard earned money. Moisture and electronics doesn’t mix. Why on earth would you waste money on a product that has a high likelihood of shorting out soon after the warranty expires?

The headband. I can’t even believe they poorly designed such a critical piece of the product. The headband’s support system is made out of (wait for it) MESH!!!!! Think about that folks. All that’s keeping the metal frame of the headphones from painfully resting DIRECTLY on your head is a very thin layer of mesh of which over time begins to sag, and when it does, the consumer instantly goes from having pain in their wallet, to pain on their head as well. I cannot for the life of me understand why they would have designed the headband with such a flimsy support system.

Comfort is a serious issue as well. The clamping force coupled with the sheer weight of the headphones is straight up ridiculous. I do not recommend these headphones at all. Not to mention the returns process is PAINFUL. I can only imagine that Apple makes it that way to discourage returns in general for products purchased through AMZ. You could potentially have to wait up to 30 days to get a refund due to Apple’s requirements to return this particular product.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Great, but…","Audio
For a wireless headphone - The audio is very good. Great soundstage. Critical listening can be done with these…it won’t be the same as a wired headphone and amp. Enjoying music on the go is where it shines.

Device switching
Switching between Apple devices is tightly integrated and happens seamlessly. From iPad to iPhone to Mac to Apple TV.

Battery
No issues with battery …but…

Sucky stuff (tier 1 downside)
No dedicated power off switch. Although, via updates over the years, Apple has stubbornly added low power mode to save face for not having an off switch or feature. Weird.

Completely Insane (tier 2 downside)
Comes with a weird, bra-like case that offers no protection. All other competitors come with a hard case. So, you spend a sack of money on these and then have to spend extra on a case. INSANE! Apple Executives, are you aware that people have something called jobs and in these jobs we get paid something called salaries and these salaries when spent on items like these, should get us a complete purchase - especially at such a high price point.

BONKERS (tier 3 downside)
Ok! You’ve reached boss level of downsides. Apple reintroduced these in 2024 with a USB-C connector and no H2 chip - which is in the Airpod Pro earphones (UEM).

Dear God, why!?

I also own the Airpod Pro IEM and they’re AWESOME. Ability to answer or dismiss calls, start stop workouts etc, the noise protection while in transparency mode-
For example, a loud bang occurs while you’re in transparency mode - the Airpod Pros will mute the loud noise to save your hearing- the Max amplifies it. Yummy.

Then why get these - I wear them during the winter commutes - so they also double-duty as ear muffs. Also, when I put up my jacket hood, they don’t dislodge like the AirPod Pros and fall in the NYC sewers where the rats and CHUDs get to enjoy Jazz on my dime.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 Heavy but worth the price.","I recently got this AirPod max. The AirPods Max stand out with their exceptional sound quality, durable build, and eye-catching design. Seamless connectivity with Apple devices is a breeze. However, their significant weight can cause discomfort during extended wear.","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025"

Sound is the best I have heard in ANC headphones. ANC tech is great as well. Construction is solid. Not plasticy parts to break. Love the removable ear pad/cups.The Bad:Uncomfortable. The metal head band is to tight and hurts the top of my head as well as the sides after about 30 to 40 minutes of use. There is no way to fix this as the metal has no give. Because they are metal they are also heavy. There is also no way to connect a 2.5/3.5 adapter due the the USB port being only for charging. This was cheaping out on the Apple side cause they did'nt want to update the chip to support sound over USB-c. This worked on the old lightning cable version of the headphonesSummary: for this price they should be perfect.... but far from.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

Comparing them, the noise cancelling is better in the Max, but the transparency is better on the Pro 2s. Max is slower to connect also. Overall they sound good and reasonably comfortable. My main reason for buying these is the better noise canceling and I am happy with that. I just wish they updated the chipset and added new features like pausing when you speak like the Pro 2s do.","Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2024"

 I love them, but not likely worth the super premium price unless you're 100% Apple","I struggled for a while to convince myself I should pay the massive premium for the AirPods Max. I pulled the trigger and don't really regret it.

The major, major pro is they actually seamlessly switch from my MacBook to iPad to iPhone. Connectivity is very reliable. I recently switched from windows to Mac, and not sure that was the right call, but some of MacBook features maybe make up for the 30 years of windows familiarity. I say that because without a MacBook for daily work use, I'd have less conviction on the reason to spend so much on headphones. The switching is super valuable for teams/zooms on laptop and then phone calls, or listening to podcasts on laptop or tv shows on iPad then phone calls.

In terms of ease of use, they are super easy. Just put on your head and all your devices activate and are ready to use. They are also comfortable. Other headsets I've had issues at the top of my head with the crossbar becoming uncomfortable after a while, which isn't the case with these.

Sound quality is quite good. Is it worth the premium to other high end headphones like Bose or Sony that get rated high, I'm not sure. My guess is not really. The Spatial Audio is weird. I love the idea, but not sure it seems immersive when my eyes are looking at a 13" laptop or 11" iPad, though it's fun to play with and hear the sound exclusively in my left ear when I look right and vice versa.

Noise cancelling is very good. Again, worth the premium, probably not. Music is great to listen to, but while I have a decent ear for sound, I'm certainly not an audiophile.

Transparency mode is incredible. First few times I used it I was very impressed. Genuinely feels like you don't have headphones on. One subtle exception is on a plane. That's where you can tell it's done with microphones because when using it, the ambient noise can somewhat drown out the person you actually want to talk to. It can be better just to take it off one ear.

Color and styling are great, as you would expect from Apple.

It's probably stating the obvious, but all all attributes are significantly better than ear buds. I've had AirPod pros, Beats Studio and cheap ones and there just is no comparison. I fly almost weekly and also decided that the large form factor was worth it because I'm 99% confident I won't leave them behind, which I have done with buds. They also never fall off like buds.

It's quite possible I have an odd shaped head, but the buds never EVER work for phone calls unless I'm in a stationary quiet place. Outside or hotel lobby, forget it I have to use wired or the handset. So I'm done with them. Doesn't seem to be an issue with the AirpodMax. Though I can definitely say they are not 100% reliable when in movement in places like a dog walk or airport, where I've experienced issues being heard. Not as bad as the buds, but still frustrating given the price point.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Underwhelming after 6 weeks","Me saying this in retrospect but also giving an opinion: I got mines from Apple directly (in the mall); i’m doing a comparison with the one from Amazon and— this one. They’re the same, literally, the only difference is the noise cancellation, it allows some noise in, when you push the oval button for ANC. Besides ANC, transparency mode on this is extremely good for calls. I can only hear the person who i’m speaking with. For ANC it blocks out noise, and the music depending on what genre, could be EDM, pop music or bass boosted songs, it generally sounds more crispier on the higher spectrum. The mids on the other hand, have a more tumultuous sound in some songs that are quite notable. I should’ve gotten something else cheaper but the battery life is worser than the XM5s. Again just in general, super underwhelming after like 1-6 weeks. Even 1 week if you want a perpetual comfort experience.Audiophile opinion:  Most of you reading you’ve probably been watching videos on what’s the best pair of headphones in a general assessment. Kinda difficult to explain or give a definitive answer; since it all depends on user preferences. I Had the XM4s, 5s, bathys, even the recent earbud beats sets that i gave to my mom (Which was a disappointment from initial time of release). But yeah like i spent a lot of money over the years on sound quality, bass, mids, etc., but i can’t help myself make an apple airpods max pro with a USB-C review. With a more realistic perceptive on a general consumer basis.(1): For the Price, it’s underwhelming for what it is, i have a few problems with comfort as well.(2): Everything else is fine, it’s just that it squeezes my skull too much. The Sony XM4s feel super comfortable, even though they’re ugly, they feel much lighter too. They like feel so good but the Maxes, maxes out on the sound quality and ANC, for lack of a better word.(3): In hindsight, i feel like the connectivity should’ve been fixed for older iphones, i have the 8 plus still and the 12, both had eccentric connectivity glitches or bugs if that’s how you call it. But yeah like i just wish the value for money for the Maxes wasn’t so overpriced and overhyped.(4): And to wrap things up, for functionality; it works great. There’s a ton i didn’t mention but yeah.Overall experience, i give this a 4 stars, not 5 certainly not the best. I would say the XM5s for like a muddier bass or muffled in some cases. If you want to go for the Maxes for like general sound quality, if i mean so emphatically, for that purchase go for it. For comfort, it’s staggeringly out of place in terms of price, and it should be improved. But anyhow thanks for reading 👌.","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025"

    Basically the same as the lightning version ... with one surprise.","Let me set the stage upfront. I love the Airpod Max as such for their build quality, features, and overall sound quality, especially when used with Apple devices. And to support that statement, I even "side-graded" the Lightning version (2020) to the USB-C (2024). Now, there are no claims of any other changes than colors and the USB-charging port. Beyond that, the hardware and functionality remain unchanged (i.e., no H2 chip). That said, this is what I assumed, and it holds mostly true except for one surprise.I don't have to spend much time on the great build quality, excellent ANC (active noise cancellation) and good sound quality. Many have written about the equally high price and the nearly pointless smart case. Depending on your preferences, those are all true or overblown.The premium (metal) build makes this headset sturdy and somewhat heavy. By itself, not a major deal, but when added to other devices, every gram counts in the carry-on luggage. But weight is ironically not the biggest issue for travelers. People already criticized the Lightning version for its missing 3.5mm port for traditional audio cables, like those used with in-flight entertainment systems. The 2024 update does not change that. What appears to be a logical change from lightning connector to USB-C turns out to be a puzzling omission.The 2024 version may now charge via a common USB-C cable, and the mentioned Lightning audio cable naturally wouldn't fit, but as of January '25 there is no sign of a (custom) audio cable for wired audio. A generic 3.5mm to USB-C cable will not work, and it's not clear that the headphones even have the capability or if there ever will be such cable! I find this rather bold to keep the design effectively the same and yet remove one feature. Sure, there is an increasing number of 3.5mm to wireless (BT5.x) dongles, but it still feels like a downgrade, and it's one more device you need to keep charged.Overall, the headphones are a solid 4.5 in terms of ANC, build quality, and sound. If you already own the Lightning version, I feel this USB-C is in no way an upgrade and may even be the downgrade I mentioned above. Part of me would like to see a truly upgraded AirPod Max 2 with H2 chip and fewer limitations, even if that means that my most recent update to the USB-C version was not the best use of my resources.","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Excellent quality as you would expect from Apple","I purchased the “Starlight” color which looks nearly identical to the older “Silver” version to replace the “Green” one that I gave to my boyfriend. Other than insisting that I update my iPhone 14 to the latest iOS (18 at this time) and the usb c port replacing the lightning port on the older version, I couldn’t really tell the difference between the older and newer versions. What exactly does the new version do differently that justifies the “Professional” noise cancellation added to its description and the $100 added to its price tag? Answers -anyone?That said, save some money and buy the older version which does everything just as well which is to say they are well made, comfortable, neutral sounding headphones that cancel extraneous noises extremely well.","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024"

    $550 for the same 4-year old internal tech simply packaged in new colors?  Get the cheaper Airpods.","For a tech company, after not updating a product for over 4 years, was shocked hat apple didn't make a single update to the internals (chips, sound quality, noise cancelation, features) in this release.  Still has the H1 chip, and considering that both the cheaper Airpods and Airpods Pros both have the newer H2 chips, is really embarrassing when trying to charge $550 for a 'premium' product.  Would recommend waiting until they actually update the technology from 2020, or just buy the more powerful Airpod Pros at more than half the price.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024"

 Mixed feelings about the product, absolutely do not purchase from Amazon","The headphones themselves are aesthetic as all get-out, and function as well sound-wise as you would expect an Apple product to function (read: great). The issue (for me at least) is that the comfort and wearability is abysmal.

I actually went on a headphone bender, and tried out some 10+ headphones over the last few years from all the "best" between $150–$400. Compared to most of the competition, the AirPod materials are uncomfortably rough, the thing is too heavy to sit on your head (slides off if you look up) and the weight becomes a burden for any long wearing session.

At best, this is probably a good buy if you have a lot of hair to cushion the thing both from movement and boring dents into your dome. I do not have much hair to speak of, so for the more shaven of us, this is not the fit.

NOW THE REAL WARNING: If you purchase from Amazon, you are potentially setting yourself up for a nightmare return scenario. Amazon and Apple have some wacky contract that requires a host of extra steps to even start the return, and additionally REQUIRES a UPS pickup. What's so bad about that you ask? Well, if you live in a gated apartment like me, you may find that UPS doesn't do door pickups, and attempting to contact the delivery person to figure out a solution is a fools errand. I spent 57 days, calling amazon support, calling UPS support, waiting on automated support lines, trying desperately to convince customer support rep #43 that no, UPS will in fact NOT pick up the headphones, no matter how many times we restart the process. It was a miserable waste of time that was only rectified after I gave up on customer support and filed a customer complaint, which magically connected me to the delivery person to set up a secret package transfer.

Will this happen to you? Probably not. But heed my warning! If anything goes wrong in the return process, you may find yourself in a pit of helplessness between two massive companies who will be happy to pass you back and forth for hours, days, weeks, months, because the companies have return policies that awkwardly counter each other.

Buy from Amazon if you know without a shadow of a doubt you will not need a return. Otherwise, buy from Apple, or anywhere else with a reasonable policy.

Bonus review: Bluetooth headphones all suffer (to varying degrees) from some level of hissing and interference, these headphones included. If you're just looking for audio quality, find a good set of cable headphones. Even in 2025, you are sacrificing audio quality for Bluetooth capability. Sometimes that's worth, up to you, GL","Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025"

    Only worth it when it's on sale","I'm an audiophile snob, but I also accept things for what they are and not think of products negatively just because they're not something they're not. I'm going to pragmatic as possible and talk about the APMs (AirPods Max) and how they perform from my perspective as an audiophile.First note: I'm kind of tired of people asking if these headphones can play "Hi-Res Lossless" with their Apple Music, even if the song was mastered this way. The APMs maxes out at 24 bit 48khz, which makes it capable for regular "Lossless" and "Dolby Atmos".Sound Quality:I would say that the sound quality is good, but in a highly corrected and synthesized way. It just sounds "clean" that you get with these modern bluetooth headphones. I'm ok with this and accept this for what it is and I'm not expecting Focal Clear OG or MG levels of sound quality via analog DAC and Amp combo. I can also say that I prefer the timbre coming from the APM vs. the Bose QCs or the Sony XM. The latter two has better ANCs, but I personally think the APMs have a more neutral sound profile. If you want the best BT wireless headphones that's tuned very well, look into the Focal Bathys.ANCsI think the ANCs got worse with the APMs as Apple pushed out some firmware update for it in the last couple of years. Transparency mode is top notch and still considered one of the best, but if you're looking for raw ANC tuning, I would still say that the Sony XMs and Bose QCs are superior, but not by much. The Focal Bathys is very good in this regard, but I would personally place those in last place from the other three.Practical Build QualityThese are much better build quality than the Bose and the Sony, which were designed to be mass produced, built to meet profit margins type of headphones. The APMs feels much more premium in comparison, however Apple still have no figured out or fixed the moisture build up issue (your miles may vary) if you're the type to build up moisture around you ear. Also the travel/charging case for the APMs are some of the worst designed - ever. It's annoying that it doesn't fold, but I don't think that's fair to say because the Focal Bathys doesn't fold either and it's just as bulky.The main reason why you buy these:You just want headphones that meshes super well with your other Apple devices due to the (now 4 years old) H1 chip that seamlessly connects to all your Apple devices. This is something that none of the other ANC BT headphones can match on any level. Even with the Focal Bathys, which trounces the APMs in terms of audio quality, I use less and less because the APMs are just so much more convenient to use.Elephant in the room:The Apple H1 chip is old AF and with this latest release of the USB-C model, this is an obvious sign that Apple has no plans to further improve the Airpods Max as part of their roadmap. While their other Airpods like the Pros and their regular series of Airpods continue to receive cutting edge updates (H2 chip and better ANC technology), the 2024 APMs are recycled version of the 2020 APMs with USB-C at best. I would personally save your money and not purchase these at full price for such out of date and blatant money grab at $549.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025"

    Amazing, but overpriced.","These headphones are VERY comfortable & the Spatial Audio is fantastic w/ great noise canceling. However, the mic is average and not the best for remote working in public spaces, and its other features are not so much better than the competition to justify the price. They also have zero water resistance, whereas others have at least IPX4 water resistance, so these would not be great workout headphones. There’s no off button, it expects you to use the case. Otherwise it goes to sleep while draining battery the whole time. Lastly, not great outside the apple ecosystem— like if you use other Bluetooth devices or PCs not Apple.In the end, they are just headphones, only one main function — and I could not justify spending more than $400 (even after tax) on these, let alone the $500+ listed price tag.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

 Worth every penny for peace and perfection","I absolutely love my AirPods Max. They’re everything I could want in over-ear headphones and more. First off, they’re amazing ear muffs in the winter—cozy and practical! The noise cancellation is brilliant and blocks out everything, whether it’s a noisy commute or the chaos of my house while I’m cooking dinner. The sound quality is superb, and phone calls are crystal clear. They hold a charge for nearly all day, which is a lifesaver.

I’ve tried Bose and Sony over-ear headphones, and while they’re great, the seamless connectivity across my Apple devices is what makes these stand out. Switching between my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook is effortless.

Sure, they’re pricey, but for the comfort, sound quality, and ease of use, they’re worth it. And yes, I’m a grown woman who probably looks like I’m about to jump into a Call of Duty game while wearing them—but I don’t care. These headphones are a game-changer for anyone who values peace, focus, and great sound. Highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2025"

 Sounds amazing","If you’re looking for a pair of wireless earbuds for working out, Apple AirPods are a fantastic choice. The sound quality is truly impressive—crisp, clear, and rich, whether you’re listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls. For workouts, the most important thing to know is their fit and performance during physical activity. The snug fit ensures they stay in place, even during intense exercises.

Another standout feature is the variety of colors available; I love the one I chose! It adds a touch of personality, making them feel unique and stylish. The seamless connection with Apple devices is also a game-changer. You can switch between devices effortlessly, and the long battery life means they’ll keep up with you throughout your workout and beyond.

Overall, if sound quality, style, and convenience are high on your priority list, Apple AirPods are an excellent investment for fitness enthusiasts.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025"

 Great headphones","I have many sets of headphones, some very nice ones, and these stand alone in terms of being something different - there is so much tech jammed into these, it makes them very different than anything else on the market.

Sound - Sound quality on these is very good, very clean. Personally I'd like a lot more bass, but even someone who isn't a basshead would still probably like more bass. They're not weak or anything on the low end side, and booming bass is there, it's just too much in the background for my tastes. If stupid iOS just gave you an EQ, you could probably easily fix this, and some of the sound profiles you do get can hep, but for the love of everything, just give me a stupid EQ so I can choose the sound I want. In any case, again, the sound is very good, very clean. I'd say it's pretty easily better than my Bose QC25 but not on-par with my Beyerdynamic DT 990 open backed headphones (which I still think are the best headphones I've heard and I've compared them against sets costing well over $1k). But these headphones are about a lot more than sound, and that's why they go up to 5-stars...

Sound Field/Stage - The sound stage on these, the openness of the sound, is amazing for closed back headphones. When you're playing music that supports Apples spatial sound (everything in Apple Music for example) it's incredible, it really feels/sounds natural a lot of the time. I've used other 'virtual surround' garbage, and it's terrible, but whatever Apple is doing, it works. My favorite thing is that you can set your phone in front of you, then walk around, and it sounds like the sound is coming from the direction of the iPhone, so it gives you this incredible sense of space (and it does not hurt the sound quality - for most music it sounds better in my opinion). This is something you really have to experience to understand as I don't know of anyone else that does this - and it's really impressive in person.

Noise Cancelling - Absolutely top notch. Between the good fit of the headphones and the actual tech, you can block out a ton of stuff, they work better than my Bose QC25's, that still were best in class as of a year ago. Also, for the cry babies, I do not notice the pressure effect - it might be there still, but it's not nearly as noticeable as the Bose.

Battery Life - Seems to be excellent. Only downside is it uses an iPhone plug, not USB C. I still have and need an iPhone plug so it's not a huge deal at the moment, but for the future, when it's all USB C, this is going to become a pain.

Comfort - It's pretty comfortable. I heard lots of people say these are big and heavy and uncomfortable, and while they are big and heavy, for me at least they're pretty comfortable. Those Beyerdynamic DT 990 are amazingly comfortable, can wear them for hours, that's not the case here. But compared to my Bose QC25, I can wear the AirPods Max for longer without any issues. Still, it's not like the comfort of earbuds, which I can wear all day, but for big over the ear headphones, the Max's are pretty good.

Build Quality - Top notch in my opinion, make everything else I've ever used, anything else I've ever even tried, feel plasticky and cheap.

Wireless - No lag, no drops, works great. I wish they had upped the bandwidth so you could carry stuff like fully uncompressed audio, like blu-ray audio, but probably have to wait for V2 for that. With that said, I've never really noticed anything, everything sounds full with no compression. Obviously that isn't the case, but just saying, I do not notice any negatives as far as wireless goes.

Overall, 5-stars. The sound, with less bass than I'd like and with no EQ in iOS, only gets 4-stars, but the other features make these unique and quite amazing. The spatial sound is what makes these special, and you can't get that with any other over the ear headphones, and it works remarkably well. I think it uses actual head movement for tracking, so it's not just a software gimmick they can do on any other headphones (I think that's the case), but it' something you need to hear in person to appreciate.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2021"

 blew my mind","Why aren’t all headphones this nice??? I wish I’d bought these ages ago. They fit my head perfectly without sliding around or needing adjustments constantly. The music quality when paired with Lossless Audio on Apple Music is pretty astounding. The quality of these can’t be matched - the metal frame and sophisticated design make for heavy, but excellent, product. The battery life seems great so far - I’ve listened to a few hours uninterrupted and haven’t had to charge them yet. Honestly, the price point here sounds insane, especially because they charge via lightning cable and not USB-C. However, you get a product that I just can’t dismiss because of the price tag. The performance so far is simply astounding. Thanks to Prime Day prices, I finally bit the bullet, and I’m soooo glad I did.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2024"

 Great product but returned due to fit","I gave these 5 stars because I absolutely loved these headphones but ended up returning them due to them being uncomfortable. The sound and noise cancellation was great and definitely better than the AirPod Pros. The reason I returned them was because they squeezed too hard on the arms of my glasses, so after I wore them for longer than 20-30 minutes I would start to get a headache. I have the thicker plastic framed glasses and just felt like these weren’t the right choice for that, this isn’t a problem I’ve had with some other over the ear headphones. When I wore them without glasses this was not a problem at all and I thought they were really comfortable. I have some friends that have these and they have the wire frame glasses and they did not have this problem either. If you’re planning to buy these and have the types of glasses that I do, just make sure to give them a heavy trial run before the return window closes. I was able to return them without any problems and got my full refund. I also got a refund back for my Apple care which I’ve seen is not always the case so that was an unexpected surprise. All in all I definitely recommend these to anyone who doesn’t wear glasses/has smaller frames.","Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2023"

 Overall, I'm glad I have them","I was soooo torn on getting these (mainly because of the cost and how "outdated" they are). For weeks I wasn't certain if I was going to keep them or not -- the size isn't convenient to travel with, when I stop wearing them for a few days I need to get used to the weight of them again and they need to be charged every few days which gets annoying.
That being said, I video edit A LOT so the small buds ache in my ears quite quickly.
I found myself always grabbing these headphones (even on the go, despite the size) and miss them when I don't have them available. I love the noise cancelling and the sound machine option (especially for flights). The transparency mode sounds too artificial for me so I'd rather keep it off.
I wish I could say they aren't worth the cost but I couldn't get myself to return them. Overall, I'm glad I have them.","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024"

    Random crackling and distortion","Hello!I've had these headphones in my cart for a while and thought I'd bite the bullet during this most recent prime day. Love the look. Yes, they are heavy but whatever I honestly like it. Noise canceling is also great which is a big thing for me! I've had the Bose headphones for a while and the most recent Bose QuietComfort are lacking in the noise canceling department. Big reason why I decided to look elsewhere!Now, I haven't had these headphones for a while. I JUST opened them yesterday. First song I listened to was great. Second song I listened to was going well until I opened iMessage. The song started to distort. I was really confused so I backed up to make sure it wasn't the song. It wasn't. Right now I am listening again and while I'm toggling through different sites on my web browser, and even clicking on the different colors that the headphones have to offer, the headphones are giving off a static and crackling sound. I'm just a little nervous since I JUST bought these and this has started to happen right off the bat.Has this happened to anyone else? Does it get better? Does it get worse? These are so expensive and if this is going to keep happening I'm gonna be pretty disappointed :/ Gonna keep using them and will change my rating if I feel it gets better but for now... yeah I'm unsure! Sucks because the sound quality when this isn't an issue is great... but it just keeps happening!For the record - I am using Spotify and have connected the headphones to my iPhone 14 pro max and my 2022 Macbook air.

    They’re great headphones overall!","Ok, I’ve had these for a few weeks now and here’s my thoughts.First, the pros. Honestly they are pretty comfortable and yes, very pretty. Let’s be honest, who doesn’t love Apple’s aesthetic? I got the green color and it’s gorgeous. I love that they come with a nice little case too. The battery life is great, I can do about a weeks worth of workouts without going below 25% battery. They also charge super quickly. The sound quality is good! They’re also nicely padded. They also stay put while I’m running which is a huge plus.Cons: the sound is good, but I don’t think they’re $500 good. I really wanted to wait for the next gen to come out but I don’t think they’ll be out for quite a while from what I have heard so I bit the bullet and splurged. I did buy a case for the actual headphones because I don’t love that the fabric padding gets so sweaty when I work out, but the case I bought seems to help with this a lot. All in all, they’re probably the best headphones I have used to date. However, there is always room for improvement (:","Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2023"

    Nearly perfect - the Apple AirPods Max falls short in one small but annoying way","I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Max and have been extremely happy with my purchase - with one small exception. These headphones are absolutely amazing in every other way - the sound quality is top-notch, the noise cancellation is excellent, and the build quality is top-notch. The case is also a nice touch - it's convenient and protects the headphones when I'm on the go.However, there is one small issue that has been driving me crazy - the inability to turn off the headphones without putting them back in the case. This is a feature that doesn't help to conserve battery life, and can be extremely inconvenient when I just want to take a quick break from listening to music or make a phone call without having to fumble with the case. It's a small annoyance, but one that I hope Apple will address in future versions of the AirPods Max.Overall, despite this one small issue, I am extremely happy with my purchase of the Apple AirPods Max. They are a truly top-notch pair of headphones and I would highly recommend them to anyone in search of excellent sound quality and noise cancelling technology. Just be prepared to put up with the minor inconvenience of having to put them back in the case to turn them off.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022"

    Life changing","I do not usually review products, AND these have literally been life changing. I have become an audiophile, have a small head (most adult/quality headphones are too big/heavy), wear glasses (turns out this combination gives bad headaches if you feel your head is in a vice) and have long hair (meaning in-ear headphones often times give static feedback as my hair rubs against the microphone). I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a just right audio/headphone options and regret not initially investing in these. They fit my small sized head, are not too tight, completely cover my ears to not hurt/irritate my earring holes/ears or weigh on/squeeze my head/glasses. The audio quality is amazing and they pair with my other apple devices (computer/phone) seamlessly. I can wear them over one ear or both (as I have kids and audio-feedback from the environment is often helpful). These drown out irritating noises and I love the controls. I also appreciate that if I pull an earphone away from my head to listen to something/hear someone everything is paused for a moment and resumes when I put them back over my ear. So practical and helpful. The only concern I have is not being able to tell the difference between quality sound coming from speakers everyone can hear or headphones...and my heart Is happy and quality of life improved exponentially.","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2023"

    Not substantially better than airpod pros unless volume is turned up","At about double the cost of the airpod pros, I've found that the maxes unfortunately do not provide double the listening experience. I do find that I'm able to pick up more details, and am occasionally delighted at new sounds I'm able to hear, but I would say that overall these delights do not justify the large price tag, at least with respect to audio quality.That said, the noise cancellation is really, really good. It's made cross-country flights (in the United States) much more enjoyable, and I look forward to wearing this on my trip to Korea (about 14 hours.) In addition, the long battery life is much welcomed. Unfortunately, the headphones do apply some pressure to my head, and I find that I need to take a break from them after 2-3 hours. During this time, I swap my airpod earbuds in, and the difference in noise cancellation is always very noticeable.All in all, the Airpod Max, does not give me a drastically improved listening experience, but makes up for it with its much longer battery life and noise cancellation.","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2022"

    Amazing Even With The Drawbacks","These headphones… are amazing. The audio quality is fabulous, they last all day and then some, and they don’t hurt sensitive ears (iykyk). There are 2 drawbacks though: price point and top of head comfort. The band is ridiculously uncomfortable. I purchased silicone protectors for these, and it made the top of the headphones even more uncomfortable and pulled out my hair. Due to this, I’ve been using them without the top silicone protector. I will say it does stop after continuous use (and I personally am willing to let it slide), but definitely worth mentioning for people with potential sensory sensitivities. The noise cancellation is phenomenal as always, and the volume control is the cherry. Going from AirPods to these, the volume control wheel is a lifesaver. I adore these. I use them frequently and I would purchase them again, even if they are expensive. To me, they are worth every penny. 10/10","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2023"

    Most comfortable headphones for my head.","I was never a fan of over-ear headphones because every pair I’ve tried has always made my head hurt after less than 30 minutes of wearing them. These, on the other hand, I am able to wear on the plane for around 6 hours, sleeping during some of that time! I’ve also worn them lying in bed for meditations, and find that they do not get in the way or become uncomfortable.They sound good to me, but I don’t consider myself an audiophile, so not sure how this sounds to the more trained ear. I will say that it does sound crisp and clear, and the noise cancellation is incredible. It really feels like all the sound around me gets sucked up. On top of that, the transparency mode is great! I’ve had the AirPod Pros (Gen 1) and absolutely loved how natural my voice sounds, and the same can be said for the AirPod Max. I do not regret making this purchase, but only because I was able to get it at a discount. I probably wouldn’t have bought it at full price.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2022"

When my pair came I was a little concerned because I’ve never owned headphones and when I wore them for a long time they kind of gave me a headache and didn’t feel very secure on my head, but the more I wore them the more I got used to them and now no matter how long I wear them I never get a headache, they are actually incredibly comfortable, and weirdly the more I wear them the better they stay on my head. I wear them to gym and they stay on no problem. I haven’t done any running with them on yet though so not sure how well that would work out. Overall I do not regret this purchase one bit and I would definitely recommend them, especially to people who struggle with anxiety and adhd.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022"

Super comfortable over my ears and on my head, I was worried it would hurt my ears but it doesn’t. I have earbuds from Beats and those are amazing too. These I love for more long term wear to enjoy music or tv and not bother neighbors or anyone else in the home. Like my own personal concert/movie theater. I just got an Apple TV and while setting it up it picked up on my headphones and I was so excited! I’m now watching a loud movie with my headphones on while someone is sleeping in the other room.

    Probably the best consumer headphones going.","So there are obviously $20,000 headphones with dedicated amps and stuff for rich jaguar owners to have manhood measuring contests about, but man, these things sound fantastic even at their pricepoint (from anyone’s perspective). Also, they are the somgle best noise cancelling tech i’ve heard, and the transparancy function is something i didn’t know i couldn’t live without until i used it. Laying in bed listening to music or videos, but still able to hear if my wife mumble asks me for something half asleep? Priceless. Plus the positional audio thing is kind of cool. One if the better other features: direct connect to apple tv for latenight viewing.Construction and materials are superb. I might change the earcups out for leather eventually, bit the fabric has been fine for several hour con calls and music sessions.The metal is nice, the feel of the headband extenders is premium.My only complaint is the magnet system to wake them up is inconsistent and has left them dead until i plug them in even with half battery left a couple of times.

    Great headphones but overpriced, don't hold their charge, and difficult to use in flight","These headphones cost about $200 more than their closest competitors. They do sound great, and the NC is amazing. But they don't stay charged when not in use. Another dumb Apple thing, like not having a touch screen on a laptop, is that you can never turn these headphones off. You can only put them in "low power mode" by placing them in an appropriate case for the purpose. But if I don't use them for a few days, say a week, even if well charged when put away, they will be completely dead, unusable, when I take them out of the case. They are also difficult to use in flight. You've got to purchase in advance a separate $50 device to connect them. The first time I flew with them I did not know this, so again, like pulling them out of the case uncharged, they were unusable and I was stuck with the in-flight earbuds. Shame on Apple for not making this known in the set up instructions for the devices. So for their ridiculous cost, their inability to hold their charge when not in use, and the trouble using them in flight, I do not recommend these headphones and would not buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2023"

    Game changer","Almost pristine noise cancellation - an ideal solution for a complex problem. Heightens focus and productivity while working, and calms when at rest. I use them with meditation apps, podcasts, music, and film/video. All flawlessly connect and the sound quality is awe-inspiring. These are a gift that will continue giving back with time the longer you keep them.One drawback that I have found is the tendency for the cushions to absorb sweat and take on odor. After finding their instructions on cleaning the cushions on their website unhelpful, I spoke with Apple support, who advise using a dryer sheet to clean the cushions. This helps, but there is a tendency for the product to get dingy with lots of use. There should be more water resistance and more ways to clean the ear cushions.Update: while you won’t find this piece of advice on the forums, a trick for cleaning the smell out of the cushions is non-chlorine bleach, e.g. oxyclean liquid. Spray on the cushions and let it penetrate, then leave them under a fan to dry. I tried putting the cushions in the freezer to get the smell out, but the best bet was non-chlorine bleach.","Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2021"

    problematic from day one","when they work, they work great. But if I turn on noise cancellation there's a buzzing/crackling sound in the left side. I've had Apple replace these twice and it still happens.  Now lately they sometimes don't charge. I've had to do a hard reset to get them to pair or charge multiple times over the last month.  I probably won't buy another Airpods Max again.","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2024"

    Love them!","These are amazing! I have AirPods Pro’s and these are much better in noise cancellation and noise quality! Love them so much, however I will say I can’t workout in them because I have a super small head and even in the smallest setting they fall off if I do too much in them, like unloading my dishwasher is the most I can do and even then I feel sometimes like they might fall off. I do have a small head though but other than that I love them! They work perfect for school and work! One other thjnk is I wear makeup and they don’t take off the makeup like when I lift it up I don’t see a line where they were but the headphones get dirty with the makeup and it gets hard to clean off","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2022"

    Not worth the hype","I had high hopes for the Apple earphones due to all the hype surrounding them, but unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. One of the major issues I encountered was their weight - they feel excessively heavy on the head, causing discomfort during extended use. Moreover, the fabric surrounding the earphones turned out to be a nuisance as it made my skin itchy, which was a significant letdown.Another frustrating aspect of these earphones was their unreliable Bluetooth connection. I found that they frequently disconnected, disrupting my listening experience and causing unnecessary hassle.While the sound quality was decent, it failed to impress me, as it didn't offer anything exceptional compared to other brands I've tried before. Overall, I believe that the Apple earphones do not live up to the considerable hype surrounding them, and I would not recommend them based on my underwhelming experience.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2024"

Easier and more reliable then AirPod Pro’s with switching.  Sound is great 👍🏼 with Apple music and iTunes movies spatial audio.  A bit heavy but I actually like it. I’ve fallen asleep with them on more then all other devices combined. Music quality isn’t too much of anything if that makes sense?  My Sony MX4 on eat better base, slightly better noise cancelling. That said my Sony’s are failing and barely a year old. The folding up is cool but one ear is distorted on my Sony’s. Sheer noise cancel Sony’s best imho. The ease of buttons I thought 💭 or uhh of but it’s Uber intuitive and not easy to bump accidentally which I appreciate more then I thought I would. Confession I’ve got about 18 sets of cans (over ears) and in ears. I’ve not stopped listening to the AirPod Max since I got them.","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2021"

Initial Bluetooth connection wasn’t successful until I connected it to the charger. Compared to the Air pod Pros it seems to switch as soon as you've placed them over your ears faster. You can see your remaining battery strength on the top right area of your iPhone and the estimated 20 hour capacity seems to be conservative. I've been advised that it warns you when reaching 20,10 and 5 percent remaining levels. The reviews that mentioned the weight being an issue are correct and you should also expect noticeable warmth buildup inside the ear cups after a short period of time, especially if you're exercising or on your Peloton.

    Not Worth The Price","I have the Airpods Pro and they're my favorite set of in-ear headphones I've ever owned, so I was really disappointed when I had to return the Maxes after just 1 week of use. I really wanted to like these headphones. but they simply aren't worth the price. Cons: 1) you can only turn noise cancellation on and off, you can't adjust the level of noise cancellation (to, say 50%), which isn't ideal, 2) the controls are not immediately intuitive and you have to go through 3 layers of settings to change basic features, 3) I know everyone knows now but the case is just inexcusable, 4) these things are HEAVY and I mean really heavy.I own a pair of Bose NC 700 and was mostly comparing the Airpods Max against those - not only are the Bose lighter in weight, more comfortable to wear, have better and more controllable features, they're also still over $50 cheaper full price than the best Airpods sale price.

 Apple Air Max","**Title: Elevating Your Audio Experience – Apple AirPods Max Review**

From the moment I unboxed the Apple AirPods Max, it was clear this was not just another pair of headphones; this is a high-end audio experience crafted with precision. The sleek design and premium materials immediately set the tone, and the moment I put them on, I was captivated.

**Design and Comfort:**
The first thing you’ll notice about the AirPods Max is their stunning aesthetic. With a striking aluminum ear cup, durable stainless steel frame, and breathable knit mesh canopy, these headphones feel luxurious. They are surprisingly lightweight, making them comfortable for extended listening sessions. The memory foam ear cushions create a perfect seal, ensuring immersive sound while providing comfort; I’ve worn them for hours without any discomfort.

**Sound Quality:**
When it comes to audio performance, the AirPods Max truly shines. The soundstage is expansive and rich, delivering deep bass without overpowering mids and highs. Whether I'm listening to classical music or bass-heavy tracks, every detail is crystal clear. The immersive experience is further enhanced by Spatial Audio, which makes movies and music feel as though they’re all around you. It’s a game-changer for home entertainment, providing an incredible sense of depth.

**Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:**
Apple has perfected the art of noise cancellation with the AirPods Max. With Active Noise Cancellation, background noise fades away, creating a cocoon of sound that allows you to focus entirely on your music or calls. Conversely, the Transparency Mode is equally impressive, seamlessly blending outside sounds so you can stay aware of your environment without removing the headphones. This versatility is particularly useful during commutes or when you need to have a quick conversation without taking them off.

**Battery Life and Features:**
The battery life is remarkable, lasting around 20 hours with Active Noise Cancellation and Spatial Audio enabled. Plus, the quick charge feature is incredibly convenient—just 5 minutes of charging provides up to 1.5 hours of listening time. The seamless integration with Apple devices is a definite perk; switching between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac is effortless.

**Final Thoughts:**
In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Max are an investment worth making for anyone serious about audio quality. They blend exceptional sound, unparalleled comfort, and innovative technology in a way that few competitors can match. Whether you’re a casual listener or an audiophile, these headphones will elevate your listening experience to new heights. I wholeheartedly recommend the AirPods Max to anyone looking for a top-tier headphone experience. You won’t be disappointed—this is what high-fidelity listening looks and sounds like!","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024"

 Seamless integration with iOS devices (EDIT: but get the extra warranty)","There are certainly cheaper headphones with equivalent sound quality, but these are well-constructed, comfortable for extended wear, have streamlined physical controls which are satisfying to use, and work hand in glove with an iPhone- it doesn't even shut off completely, it just senses when it's off your ears, and pauses playback. Removing this one layer of friction means I'm more likely to take the headphones off when I want to give my ears a breather, and the phone goes back to using its internal speaker while I catch up on email or whatever, and back into the music/podcasts just by putting the phones on. The earpads, held in place by magnets, are secure, but detach without a struggle for cleaning, and their texture is sufficiently breathable and spacious to make for long listening sessions with better overall comfort than most, IMO. L and R channels are marked by a pattern sewn inside the ear cups- a little hard to see, as it's a similar color, but easy to tell in the dark if you remember that the controls are all on the right channel. And they give you a clickable knob for volume and basic track controls, similar in feel to the crown for the Apple Watch, just on a bigger scale. The other control, a button which toggles the transparency of the noise cancellation, is immensely handy, and allows you to converse with people and clearly hear others without having to shift the phones off your ears. NC reduces even a screaming vacuum cleaner to a muted hum. The spatial audio, for apps that support it, can be a little uncanny at first, and familiar to Airpod Pro users- it does feel like the audio is coming right out of the phone, rather than the sound being piped into your ears. The default carrying case has taken criticism for only covering the cans and not providing much protection, but I kind of like it for the portability- it packs up like a little handbag, and the headstrap becomes a handle. I might buy a third party box if I ever need to pack it for a long flight, but this is fine for my daily needs. When the cans are folded for storage, the metal shells kind of clack together without the case, and is definitely in keeping with Apple's design philosophy of charging end users a lot of money for a product which demands additional accessories just to keep it from denting and scratching.
There is no traditional headphone jack on the the thing, and it doesn't look like there's even a way to connect it with an adapter, which is unfortunate and should be a dealbreaker if you need that. I just need the Bluetooth, though, and the supported BT 5.0 sounds fine to my ears.
There is an option to help locate the phones with Find My, though it will only show where they were last connected to your phone, and it even allows you to play a locator noise through the speakers, so you can hear them in a relatively quiet space from about 8 feet away. What would really have been cool is if they incorporated an AirTag in their design, because at about $500, I live with the uncomfortable possibility of them being stolen if I turn my back.
In short, they are comfortable, they are expensive, they sound great, but if you want skull-rattling bass, there are better options. They'll work with any Bluetooth-enabled source, though you'll probably only feel their full value if you intend to use them with Apple products, and if I do ever lose them, I'll be ordering a new pair the next day.
(Added 7/31)
About a month ago, I started hearing some weird distortion, then one day, six months from purchase, they just refused to sync. I don’t know exactly what the cause was, but I do wear them in hot summer weather and was surprised to find that some sweat can build up behind the ear cushions, so maybe that’s the culprit? I dunno. They’re the only Apple product I have with the AppleCare+ coverage, and replacement was quick and painless, so I consider that money well spent.
Anyway, nobody said these things were waterproof, which is why I was so careful with them. I still wear them outdoors, but now I pull the ear cushions off every few hours to see if any water has built up inside the cups. Gross.
I also toss them in a baby bottle sterilizer at the end of the day. Nobody should have to deal with manky earmuffs!","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2022"

 Spatial Audio is AMAZING for watching movies, Superb fit & finish, nice neutral sound","After two years of debating, I finally decided to buy the Apple Airpods Max after they dropped the MSRP and found them on sale for the first time. I'm normally a Bose guy and have three pairs of Bose (a regular pair w/O NC but punchier base, an older pair of NC’s, & a pair of NC700 which gI got with my 700 Soundbar, 700 Sub & 700 Surrounds)…

I also own a pair of Sony 1000’s which I bought my Dad or watching Horror movies at night after my Mom has gone to bed at night.

But the noise cancelling, fit and finish, nice neutral sound and the AMAZING “Spatial Audio” which will play Dolby Atmos while watching movies and videos (nearly all 4k UHD movies on Netflix work w/ dolby Atmos & Spatial Audio on headphones) blow all the others out of the water.

The case is made out of leather(ish)? material, which is nice, but is almost too minimalistic and won't offer much protection in a fall. Luckily, there are a bunch of cheap hard cases all over the internet for $20 or less which is much cheaper than Apple’s version.

Keep in mind I bought these mostly for watching movies but even if only use them for listening to music these headphones beat the competition all around. If you plan to use these while exercising I’d look somewhere else bc they are quite heavy and if you’re audiophile willing to spend $1,000+ on studio headphones (and the headphone amp & other accessories which usually cost more than the headphones themselves) these will not work as a substitution.

But so far, I feel these headphones justify the higher price Apple charges even at the original MSRP of $599. A competitor even had a refurbished pair for $360! I plan to sell all but my Bose 700’s to pay for these bc only these two models will allow two pairs of headphones to be used at the same time while watching a movie.. and I take especially good care of my electronics bc Im on a fixed income and each purchase is a major sacrifice.

I haventbhad them long enough to comment on battery life but connected to my iPhone automatically and walked me through the set-up process. A+++++","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2023"

 The Crown of Uneasy Elegance","Let's start with the sound. Perfect. Apple’s dynamic driver caressed every note, each whisper of Dolby Atmos a symphony crafted just for you. The Personalized Spatial Audio was almost unsettlingly good—an invisible orchestra following your every turn, as though conducting for an audience of one.

And yet… beneath the marvel, a pang of frustration: why this garish design? The knit-mesh canopy and oversized ear cups would look more at home under a hard-hat shielding a coal miner from diesel motor noise rather than adorning a technophile in a Milanese cafe. And why wouldn’t they fold? A travel companion as portable as a wrought iron frying pan. The lack of USB-C to 3.5mm functionality for plugging into airplanes or my $6000 vinyl record player? Third-class indignity in a first-class ticket.

You wear them anyway. Not because they’re perfect, but because their imperfections—like life’s—add to their mystique. Incredible sound trapped in a clownish shell. A contradiction only the bold dare to embrace. Yours for a paltry $519, imported.

If you buy the protective covers that require you to remove the earphones from the headband make sure you snap them back together really well mine was locked on but the headphones would not power on to save my life I thought I broke them somehow. No way to start a return on these just a square box pops up they need to be factory reset and that’s as far as I could ever get I mean if they won’t come on I can’t very well reset them now can I? But I decided to repeat the steps and removed the earphone and then snapped it back on and I heard it click and then powered right up! Scary crap tho thinking your stuck with a 550 dollar paperweight! The covers I got do not require you removing anything, and I purchased the ear cushions funny I sure didn’t order this color!

    Woah","Okay, so let me begin by saying that I am a shameless Apple sheep, and buy most Apple products that come out.  I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook Mini, and I'm waiting on a Mac Studio to arrive.  But for some reason I've resisted Apple's attempts to make a speaker, and I don't like to wear ear bud style headphones, so never purchased any AirPods.  I've even experimented with non-Apple music solutions including Tidal, Amazon and Spotify among others.But with the recent price drop, and the fact that I fly a lot, I decided to give these headphones a try.  I genuinely thought there was a 80% chance I'd return them, as I currently use the well reviewed Sony MX4s.The wow factor of these is unbelievable.  Watching a movie or TV show on my iPad is incredible.  I listened to the opening sequence to The Blacklist Season 1 Episode 1, which has some good audio.  My wife, who is never that impressed with audio took a listen and was blown away.I got on board with Apple Music, and listened to the lossless music, and also the specially mixed spacial audio.  Wow.  Wow again.  Yeah, I'd pay retail for these.I think the obvious gripes have been made already.  The lightening port was a bad call, but I carry those cables for my iPhone anyway, so no biggie.  Although I suspect these headphones will be the last of my devices to still require that plug.The case is idiotic, as is the decision to give me no manual control over turning them off.  You seriously have to put these things in the horrific case to put them in low power mode, and there is reasonable question as to whether this case would provide any meaningful protection of these expensive headphones.Speaking of lunacy, the steps you have to take to coax the device into updating its firmware is also Apple arrogance at its finest.  Why I can't have a standby switch or button and an update firmware option is beyond me.  And again, I'm a fanboy here.It's also pretty sad that the design allows the cans to bang together if not handled carefully, which will surely result in scratches at some point.Oh, and want to listen with a wire, enjoy buying that $35 proprietary cable from Apple.  Seriously.  This is why people hate Apple.But despite these many very reasonable gripes, the bottom line here is that these sound better than every Bose pair I have owned, my Sony MX4s, and several Bang & Olufsen sets I've had.  The seamless swiping between Apple products is also pretty sweet.  The transparency mode is probably the best on the market too.There is no doubt I'd highly recommend them.  Be aware of the need to bend a little to Apple's will, in several areas, but know that the pay off is some pretty stunning results.  I'm actually looking forward to going back to work on Monday to hear how they do on the plane.  Flying to New Orleans, so should be in the air for around 3 hours.***UPDATE: Six months later...So these are great headphones.  Unfortunately, after six months of use, it's hard to justify a five star rating.Background noise control is great, transparency mode is amazing, the sound quality is excellent.  But, they are heavy, you have to plan your entire business trip packing strategy around lugging these heavy and inconvenient items around.  I had to buy a third party case to protect them, and use it with the stupid Apple case.  They take up a huge chunk of back pack real estate.Then, after five months or so, they started randomly disconnecting.  More specifically, it seems like the sensor that decides if I am wearing them isn't functioning correctly.  So if I scratch my head or move too suddenly, they shut off, disconnect, and then I have to pull out my iPhone or iPad, force them to reconnect, and continue.  Given that these are heavy and not particularly comfortable, you find yourself trying to put off scratching an itch, just to avoid the hassle of reconnecting.My expectations rise with price, so at over $500, by far the most expensive travel headphones I've ever purchased, I do kind of expect flawless.  For all their positives, there are a LOT of negatives, which is such a shame.  I imagine that version 2 or 3 will be so cool.  And, like a total sucker, I'll probably buy them.For now, I'm going to switch to the AirPod Pro 2s, while these headphones are at the Apple Store being repaired.  I may even sell them at this point.  Such a shame.","Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2022"

    Beautiful phone conversations!","A short review, as there are audiophiles that know sound and music quality far better than I do.I work from home, as my spouse does too. She cannot concentrate on her work with music playing and I cannot work without music, thus I started wearing the over-head AirPods constantly while working from my computer. They are bit heavy, but not overly so.I've worn several different headsets with microphones while working. To answer phones, listen to music while working and not bother others, and simply use the noise cancelling features to avoid distraction.The one aspect which surprised me in a good way was the ability to have such natural phone conversations. The exterior microphones (more than one, perhaps 6) do an excellent job in transparency mode. Very natural sounding, yet able to communicate flawlessly to others during phone conversations. It's as though the person is in the room with me, a bit of overpriced Apple magic once again.","Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024"

    Be aware. These are not the latest model","I got these on a Black Friday deal when they were much cheaper. If you’re going to pay full price, you may as well order direct from Apple and get the latest model. There’s no significant update to the newest version though so if you catch the previous gen at a discount, it’s a good deal.The amazing thing about these is how seamlessly integrated into the apple ecosystem they are. Moving between devices is automatic. Listening to a podcast on your computer but you want to go to the park? The headphones instantly switch to your  phone when you go to pull up the podcast there. They switch remarkably fast and on their own. Though, as amazing as that is, it’s not like switching other headphones between devices is a chore.That’s where the amazing ends. Wait. I take that back. They’re comfortable as hell and the battery life is great. The build quality is consistent with Apple’s reputation for superb workmanship and aesthetics.Sound quality is good for Bluetooth headphones but you can get significantly better with other headphones in the same price range. I have some Bowers & Wilkins IEMs that are $100 cheaper and the sound quality is significantly better. My go to album for comparison is Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On. There’s so many layers of detail with the background voices and in the orchestration on the first track, you can get lost in whichever layer you focus on. Dozens of ways to listen to the same track. That depth and richness of detail doesn’t come through on these. These sound just a bit muffled in comparison. Still decent but not audiophile. Not even close.","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024"

    Ultra-Picky Review","Take my review with a grain of salt and or from a super picky perspective. These headphones are incredible. From the build quality, the feel, the fit, and the finish, they are worth the hefty price tag. The sound is bold with an open sound stage, medium bass at lower volumes and super punchy full bodied bass at higher volumes. The bass is not overwhelming and adds that “feel” to the music you are listening to without distortion. The issue I have is that these did not meet my expectations. I did not expect something BETTER, but I expected something DIFFERENT. I read reviews and heard feedback from some people I know and I created an expectation of my own as to what to expect with these headphones. Of course with them being Apple, they have to be great, which was true.From what I expected, the best way I can compare is when you go to an electronics store and see a super high quality QLED 4K LED Ultra HD tv in cinematic mode playing a movie and you can just tell that the scenes in the movie are on a stage or a set and you can see the layers to it, that is kind of what I expected from these headphones. I expected a super dynamic sound stage, I expected to hear each instrument and sound around me instead of layered, and to feel that I was in an open room. But that is what you’d expect from a different type of headphone. This is solely what I thought to expect, but not what I got. The takeaway from that is that my expectations were just different but I was not let down at all. I am returning them and going to do more research on what type of sound I am looking for.All in all, if you’re unlike me and my wild mind that doesn’t create images of things before you buy them, you will love these headphones. The aluminum is beautiful, the mesh on the headband feels like a cloud, and the sound and noice cancelling is spectacular. My only true gripe about the design is that when you take them off and want to put them on your neck, the bare aluminum might be uncomfortable on your collar bones. You might want to turn the ear cups and fold them flat, but they fold outward from your body and you have the whole metal body resting in your collar bones. I just wish they would fold in the other way so the ear cushions are resting on your body. And one last bit is since they fold that way, the aluminum ear cups, when folded will clank against each other and can cause scratches over time. Again, this is my extremely picky review on these headphones, but you’re probably a normal person and will love them, so please do buy them. You will not regret it!","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2023"

    Worth the money","I was a bit concerned about if it was going to be sound worth the price. I'm all in on Apple and they were on sale so I bought them. The sound was really good and it works well with my Apple devices. My only complaint is that when I start using another Apple device than the one I'm playing music on, there can be a small very short losses of sound... I suspect as it is figuring out I don't want to play sound from the new device. After a moment I can keep using the new device without any further issues. I also connected them to the Roku without any issue.","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Premium Feel Product / Subpar Noise Canx","This is exactly what kind of quality you would expect from Apple. The aluminum body with mesh head band are extremely comfortable and do not cause ear fatigue. Function controls are pretty easy to use. It does lose connection from my iPhone if let sitting for a couple weeks, but reconnecting is not too difficult. The noise cancelling could be way better for how much they cost. A pair of Sony or Bose noise cancelling headphones that cost half the price have double the noise cancelling performance. However, I prefer these because their premium feel out paces the cheaper plastic feel of competing brands. I’ve bought these for both my wife and daughter now, including mine. If Apple released another version of these with better noise cancelling, I would probably buy them too.","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024"

    Ear Cup Fabric Trade Off: Longer Lasting Than Leather, But Slightly Rough","I wish the overhead arch and / or arms extended slightly longer: feels borderline long enough for my particular head.I bent the overhead arch outward a bit to reduce uncomfortable clamping pressure, but not enough to eliminate the ear seal needed for noise cancelling.I bought after market, see through ear cup covers to protect against abrasion where the cans sometimes rub against each other when off my head, and also against other scrapes and nicks..Also an after market carry case to protect against travel damage. I chose the larger type that accepts the headphones inside their included case, rather than a smaller after market sleep mode case with no room for the included case.To preserve battery life, return headphone into your after market sleep mode (or included) case when not in use. Other reviewers are correct that an on / off switch would seem preferable to the insufficiently protective included case required to put the battery into sleep mode.Some after market cases advertising sleep mode, and are thus not big enough to accommodate the included case, may sometimes not always put the headphone battery into sleep mode, thus draining the battery. Read reviews of these cases to determine how often this occurs.No audio cord / receptacle—BlueTooth audio only.Delightfully quick BT automatic pairing with Apple products.Ear cups are magnetic and thus easily removable and replaceable, though a bit pricey. Marked L & R, ensure you put them back on the correct cup, with the letter upright, so sound holes align.Very good bass, but high end Sony cans seem a bit deeper. Sony WH-1000XM3 & WH-1000XM4 are a bit more comfortable for my particular head than AirPods Max, but WH-1000XM2 clamps too hard, while the 3 handles phone calls poorly. Myself and other Amazon reviewers experienced bad BT connection with Samsung TVs on the 4, so I returned the Sony. AirPods Max connects quickly to my Samsung TV, though not automatically as with Apple computers.Very / good battery life.Woman on the other end of a phone call said she was surprised how good I sounded through AirPods Max. So my after market protective can covers did not seem to affect phone sound quality.Build seems more durable than some other high end headphones, such as Sony, but they should for this price. This apparent durability also reduces Apple’s repair / replacement costs to those who purchase AppleCare+ with this headphone.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021"

    Surprisingly Unimpressed, AirPods 3 sound just a good.","Let me start by saying I'm not an audiophile. Just an average everyday Joe. Amazon had the Max on sale for $429 on Black Friday so I decided to give it a try. On first use I found the sound to be unexpected. I thought it might be the fact I was playing AAC music from the local library on my iPhone so I gave Apple Music a try searching for songs that would push the Max. Some songs sounded very good and some while clear and sharp where still unimpressive. So source of music will definitely matters.I continued to use the Max for a few weeks until I found a deal on the AirPods 3. Once I compared the two I knew the Max was going back.What's wrong with the Max?  First if the music is not recorded for DOLBY ATMOS, ie all of my music library it sounds terrible on the Max. I believe the reason is the Max creates a surround sound stage for everything which can not be adjusted or turned off by me to play in normal stereo. It further processes the music changing the audible levels of sounds and 3d positioning of sounds having significant change to the feel and impact. For example I used "A New Hope and End Credits" from the Star Wars Episode 3 sound track as one of my test songs it has a wide variety of instruments and stereo positioning of sounds. On the Max the song sounded very different in a bad way than on my iMac outputting to a pair of stereo Klipsh computer speakers. Instruments played on a surround sound stage making some sound very distant and some barely audible like the cymbal clashes and bass hits that make up the dramatic empire sequence starting around 6:30. I got a pair of AirPods 3 in December and they really put the Max to shame because they not only played music as I expected to hear it, it enhanced the bass and clarity of the sounds without changing the sound stage of audible levels.What did I like about the Max?  Movies recorded in Dolby Atmos like Dune on HBO MAX really shined creating a very nice surround sound stage, good bass, sharp and clear vocals bringing a level of immersion I haven't had at home before. It's worth noting AirPods 3 did just as good of a job of creating the surround sound stage only loosing to the Max's deeper bass punch.Noise Isolation?  This is not an issue for me. I have tried the Max's noise isolation and it works but it does not improve the sound quality. Maybe if I was in a noisy environment it would have been more valuable.Conclusion?  I sent the Max back just before Christmas. I paid 3rd of the price for AirPods 3 which sound night a day better since 90% of the time I use them is to listen to pop rock. 10% I use to watch particular movies where I want an immersive experience, like Dune and Matrix Resurrections (paired with the new AppleTV 4K for spatial audio support); while the Max was definitely better bass in movies.. it wasn't bassy enough to justify it's high price tag.","Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022"

    best wireless noise cancelling headphones ever but pricey","These are great, and if you can get them on sale that makes them a better value - I didn't buy them until they began to be discounted, but having had them I would probably pay retail for them in the future if I had to replace them. When using them with an apple device with spatial audio, the effect feels like I can't tell the sound is really coming from the headphones (I lift one off to check). They're super comfy and don't feel heavy, though they're metal and that can feel cold sometimes. Transparency mode is mostly great but sometimes startles if there's a loud pop noise (bubble wrap) it will amplify it a bit. Noise cancelling is the best I've ever used, and I imagine that's due to apple putting in adequate computational power into these to permit smarter/better cancellation.These look to be modular - it should possible to separately replace the headband or either ear unit using a SIM card tool - so it's slightly reparable by Apple as they don't sell those parts separately. I worry about how the head band will age or get dirty with time or if the fabric frays (it hasn't), and it looks like it can be replaced if needed. Replacement fabric ear pads are sold by apple if they get grungy but pricey.Battery life seems very long, and they charge quickly. The case is weird looking, but works well enough in my laptop bag. Materials and construction feel are top notch, these headphones feel and look very premium, though I'm not a huge fan of their color selection and the look of the ear units (too rectangular and too much like an apple watch). I would love for them to eventually sell these in more/better colors, and to even permit mix-match of different colors for the ear units and headband or even sell them separately. I also worry that apple will discontinue or alter these so that in the future it won't be possible to replace or repair parts. I have an old headphone set from another company, and I've replaced the cord and pads on that a few times over the years. I think with these it would be nice if battery, pads, and headband could be replaced for years into the future, but I doubt that that will be the case. I'm still OK with it given how much I like these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2021"

    One major issue for me","I love these headphones.  Quality is excellent, and the battery lasts so much longer than the Airpods Pro 2.  But for some reason my ears start to hurt after 2-3 hours listening.  I've tried shifting the angle of them on my ears, but so far I haven't found a solution.  Which is a shame, because I'd love to use them for much longer per session.  And I bought them on major prime day sale.  So much cheaper than normal.  Though I made a mistake in not waiting for the "newer" version that came out with a usb-c connecter/charger.  But I've still got a lightning cable, so I guess not a big issue.  If someone has a solution to my ear hurting issue, I'd love to hear your suggestions.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

I did bought a case for it since the bra looking case which does look laughably ugly in person but it covers the headphones and the bra case so I don't have to look at them.

    everything I hoped and more","My husband got me these as a surprise because I fell in love with the ones we got him and I've had them for a few months now. I absolutely love them.We both WFH in a 1 bedroom apartment so the ability to concentrate can be challenging at times. The noise cancellation on these works FAR  better than the comparable Sony and Bose that we bought for him and tried first. Excellent for plane rides, can't recommend them enough.I was unsure how I would like the mesh headband area, but its actually very comfortable.The ear pieces sit gently area the ears and have a nice cushion to them for comfort. I love that if I sit them on the couch or table or desk, they go to sleep, and when I pick them up they turn back on and are ready without any effort. This feature is super handy for me.But that leads me to the downside of that feature....A thing I would love to see improved would be the case....I nearly always put it in backwards and can't plug them in if they aren't in the correct way. It could stand to be a little more user friendly. It's just sort of clunky. You really have to pay attention to put them away the right way. So at first I didn't put them away. If you don't put them away, every little bump or rattle wakes them up (great if its on purpose, annoying when its not) and will slowly drain the battery long term. Honestly if the case was something you could use without having to think about it, these would be perfect imho.Battery life is great. Even with forgetting to put them away and accidentally bumping them on a lot, it still takes a long time to drain the battery. They really last when you properly store them in the case between uses.And, the color is better in person.Really, these are my favorite. I even bought a cable to use these with my xbox controller when I'm not working but my hubby is on a zoom meeting with a client. Love love love!","Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2022"

    Get them while they’re on sale.","I’ve owned many Bluetooth headphones (Sony mark 4 and 5s, Bose QC 45 and QC Ultras, the Sonos Aces and many others), and I think the AirPod Max’s are the best of the bunch, but there isn’t enough of a performance gap to justify the $549 price.  I bought mine at $449 and am very happy with them.  The sound is pretty neutral.  I wish the percussion was a little punchier than it is, but overall they sound very accurate. They are surprisingly comfortable, considering the weight and the mesh earcups. The noise cancellation is superb as is the aware mode.  I would recommend budgeting $20-$35 for a hard case, because the bra that they come with is a joke and not does not provide much protection.  I found a great hard case, which was on sale for just $20. Also, at their price point, multipoint connection is disappointingly absent.  Overall, they are my favorite pair of cans, unless I’m alternating between devices, and then I go to either my Sonos or QC Ultras.  Happy listening!","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2024"

    impressive if you love alot of apple products you must get these","I also own a pair of Airpods Pro (in ear) the biggest PRO is being able to move more with them not falling off your head. If you bend over with the in-ear Airpods you risk them falling out.  I can wash dishes and they start slipping out. Love how snug the airpods max wireless are.  The second issue I had with the in-ear airpods was occasional static issues thankfully I have not experienced that yet.  Now I also own a pair of Bose Quiet comfort earbuds and they perform just as well as these max wireless airpods.  Apple has good competition but I am still staying loyal.","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024"

    not nearly as comfortable as I'd hoped","I have small ears, a petite sized skull, and I wear glasses.I assumed over the ear styles would be wearable, but these AirPods Max were  uncomfortable. They made me feel as though I were  child sized. If you are petite I recommend trying these on at the Apple store before buying.There is heavy pressure from the ear cups mashing against my ears and glasses and headphones. I can take it for about 2 hours. I was hoping to wear them much longer.They sound amazing when they have something with amazing sound quality to play. When I'm in conference calls it sounds the same as anything. I wouldn’t recommend them for folks that aren’t listening to high quality audio on a daily basis.I am very surprised by how well the noise canceling  works.The case, I don’t have to say much. If you’ve seen it you already know.The price is high.Net: this was not a good purchase for me.My partner has a pair of these and he loves them. He has normal sized ears and a larger skull and he has no comfort issues. He even spent the extra $40 for the cable that allows him to use these with his Xbox and he's been loving that experience. So for some folks I think this is probably a great set of headphones.So consider what’s important for you for a moment or two before you add this to your cart. If in doubt: try them at the Apple store.If this review helped you to make a buy/do not buy decision: please consider tapping the helpful button.

They easily switch between quiet/transparent and normal mode with the tap of a button. There is a turning knob so you can perfectly adjust the volume directly on the headset. I also use my cell phone for work and need hands free options. These AirPod Max headphones do the job and more.

    Best headphones I’ve haed","I love these things, the pocket sting isn’t there for me since I had saved some Amazon gift cards for this purchase. I spent about $80 of my own cash on them, but honestly I’d gladly spend the full price after using them.They fit wonderfully and the comfort is top notch, you barely feel the weight of the cans because of the strap. The adjustments are smooth and hold steady, I was a little worried the friction based metal sliders would shift and move but true to Apple fashion, they don’t shift and slide.Audio quality is superb as well, these are my favorite things to listen on. Paired with a phone, TV, or stereo system there’s excellent bass, treble and mids.Audio cancellation is amazing and I’m sad I held out this long, I can’t hear coworkers with music and can barely hear normal conversation volume when it’s paused. I use them when mowing the lawn and they drone out the buzz of a small gas engine.People warn of water condensation and gym use for several hours. This isn’t an issue if when you take a break, just remove the cups and check for sweat droplets, wipe it out and let them air dry during your rest. As for rain…wear a rain jacket with a hood or umbrella!Pairing these is simple with Apple products, and the exact same with a windows laptop…but I don’t suggest these, or any wireless headphones for competitive shooters or rhythm gaming. There’s noticble  lag in two genres you don’t want lag.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2023"

    Can't believe how much I like these!","I'm an Apple fan - which, I think you kinda have to be in order to spend THIS kind of money on headphones like these... But I LOVE these things... ESPECIALLY with the bi-directional 3.5mm audio to lighting cord from Apple (purchased separately - this allows you to plug directly into the plane when you're on a long flight.  Yes there are portable bluetooth devices that also do this - but I didn't want yet another device to charge and maintain).The two buttons on the right ear cup do a fantastic job of controlling volume, Siri, and allowing you to change from "noise cancelling" to "transparent".  And - of course - it also has that wonderful Apple trick of connecting "automagically" to all your other Apple devices (on the same Apple ID).So - yeah - easy to use, VERY comfortable (I have a large head - so this was a big one for me), and the sound... OMG the SOUND!!!!  Don't get me wrong - I love my AirPods Pro... but the comparison between the sound on them, compared to AirPods Max, it's like comparing AM radio to a live concert hall.  They really do sound THAT good... I was VERY skeptical at first... but WOW!That said - it's still a steep price point... but - if you can spare it, these are worth it!","Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2023"

    Phenomenal sound quality for music","I thought I had been spoiled for the past year or so listening to music through my wired planar magnetic Audeze headphones with my dedictated SHIIT audio amplifier, and that the only thing better could be upgrading my equipment (I spent about $2000 on the headphones and amp which is relatively cheap for a planar magnetic setup).  I purchased the Airpods Max as a wireless option to replace my Sony WH1000-XM3 headphones, as I have several Apple devices and the XM3's can only remember one device at a time.  I also looked forward to the feature of being able to switch between Apple devices seamlessly.Surprisingly the Airpods Max sound significantly better than the wired Audeze, and a very noticeable improvement.  I'm hearing instruments in tracks that I didn't know were there.  Sounds are clearly separated with a nice wide sound stage.  The bass sounds amazing which is rare for headphones.  The headphones are so much lighter than the Audeze and I can walk around the house with them!  When I take them off, my music or playing video will automatically pause, and resume when I put them back on!  And I haven't yet explored the Surround Sound capability.The only negative is that these sound horrible for Zoom meetings.  In this department the Sony XM3's have superior sound and microphone quality.  Everything sounded metallic and screechy in the one Zoom meeting I tried with the Airpods (though it was worth it to show off my cool new headset!)Also I prefer the noise cancellation on the Sony's.  Comparing the "silencing" capability with no music playing, the Sony's produce a pure quiet, while some odd static (like digital artifacts in the silencing algorithm) are audible on the Airpods.  It doesn't make any noticeable difference when the music is playing, and here the sound quality of the Airpods completely blows away the Sony's.It is a little sad to see my expensive planar magnetic rig sitting on the desk no longer utilized, lonely for my ears...","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2021"

Very disappointed then I ordered the Sennheiser double the money is the Sony has .a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures next morning failure to connect to Bluetooth. Finally I said the hell with it and I’ll spend the big bucks and I bought the promax actually covers your ears and doesn’t touch them for somebody who works with their headphones 12 hours a day big difference in addition to that I work with a shop vac and an extractor makes a lot of noise the active noise canceling actually works, 90% of the noise is canceled. Also very user-friendly the volume button is great. That way you don’t accidentally swipe and change the song instead of increasing the volume plus the headphones don’t ask again then to get touched and hang up on a phone call and the fact that you can program for it to be either transparent mode or active noise canceling without going through the neutral in between plus it happens quick there’s no delay I know announcement like in the Sony that it’s going to do that so overall absolutely worth the $500 I spent let’s just hope it lasts longer than the Sony.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2023"

    heavy and uncomfortable","I've never regretted an apple product as much as I regret buying these headphones. These are not worth the money AT ALL. It's been about a year since I've had these and I still have to try to convince myself that they're not that bad just because I spent so much money on them because they looked cute.The AirPods max are incredibly heavy. If I'm not sitting perfectly straight and still, these will start sliding off my head. I have to adjust them constantly. I also do not have a large head, but these headphones squeeze my head and hit right where my temple and TMJ are. If I wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time I get a headache and jaw pain. Two of my friends that have bought these headphones have had the EXACT same experience.The noise cancelling is good. The other thing I like is that the ear cushion is removable and washable. That's basically all these have going for them. These are my first noise cancelling headphones, so I have nothing to compare them too. I imagine other audio brands have good noise cancellation though so I would highly recommend getting literally any other brand. I'm serious. Literally any other noise cancelling headphone is better than these - solely based on how uncomfortable and heavy these are.","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024"

The sound quality is excellent and has the same easy pairing you’d expect with any model of AirPods. They don’t make me want to throw away my pair of AirPods Pro, though. As a headphone, they’re not nearly as portable, so this is more of a luxury purchase than an everyday carry kind of thing. The cans are prone to dings being thin aluminum, so AppleCare and a silicone cover is recommended. In all, they’re an excellent pair of headphones, but get a pair of Pros if this is your first set of Apple AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024"

    Is Apple Airpods Max worth the cost?","Undoubtedly, these headphones were the most expensive that I have ever purchased ($479.00). I think that these headphones are among the best I have ever tried and this includes the Sony WH-1000XM5 which I just purchased a few days ago.The only gripe I have about the Airpods Max is that you cannot turn it off. You have to put the headphones in their smart case in order to "shut them down". Even then they do not turn completely, they just go into a very low power consumption. Another is changing the EQ settings or changing any settings except volume and noise cancellation.I would not have bought these if they were still at the same original price of $549.00.However, the reduction in price was enough to try them out.I'm glad that I did.","Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024"

    Calidad vs precio","Estéticamente son muy lindos, tienen buena cancelación de ruido, aunque los AirPods Pro también la tienen y cuestan menos de la mitad del precio de los MAX y son pesados.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024"

    Favorite Apple Product","I bought the airpods when they first came out, then I got the airpods pro, and now the airpods max. The max are by far my favorite, the noise canceling is unparalleled - you cannot hear anything when they are activated! Battery life last the longest out of the three. They are a bit on the heavy side, but easy to adjust. I highly recommend, I love mine!!","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024"

    Love them!","Iva had both the AirPods Pro and the Max, and these are amazing! I love the sound quality of these, and have found I prefer the over the ear style headphone vs the AirPod pro. While these are bulkier, they are far more comfortable for me, and I don’t have to worry about losing an earbud.","Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2024"

    WARNING FOR PEOPLE GOING TO THE GYM","I love my airpods, however one thing I would note is that these are very absorbent. Soooo if you are going to be super sweaty, they will start to stink. Make sure you get apple care, this covers replacement of the ear cushions after they get sweaty. I currently am using a gym pair (stinky) and the new ones for all other applications.Aside from the gym, these headphones are great. If you are looking for super heavy bass, maybe go with evo skull crushers instead.","Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2024"

    Amazing","I got this on sale and im happy I did. I would pay no more than $399 for this product. I think $549 original is definitely overpriced. But now I feel like it was a great investment. I recommend anyone who was considering to buy a pair to get it now while the sale lasts.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"
