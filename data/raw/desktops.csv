 Best computer I ever own, and yes the base model it is more than enought.","I had this computer for two months now and it is really excellent, It is compact, powerful, beautiful designed, silent and a very good price, I bought it to edit videos in Final Cut Pro, replacing my old 2013 Mac Book Pro 15" (2000$ at that time) with a discount for 545$, It is so much faster in every task, Im even using in blender. If you are wondering if 16GB of memory and 256GB of space are ok, I can tell you it is, just buy an external SSD an you will be fine, hightly recomended.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

What truly amazes me is how quiet and cool it runs, even when I'm pushing it hard. My old desktop sounded like a jet engine, but this little guy is whisper-quiet. Plus, it takes up barely any space on my desk!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Good computer","Hard to believe how good this little thing is. Extremely high single core speed. Good for emulation workloads. Totally quiet, too (the base model, don't know about the Pro CPU).

I have to say that I liked the larger case of the older Minis better. They had the on/off button on the side where it belongs, and they had space for USB-A ports.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

    MacOS Sequoia needs 8 GB of RAM. Meaning, only 8 GB remains for the user's activities.","No wonder the M4 comes with 16 GB of RAM standard. Glad I bought the 16 GB version of the M1 too. MacOS with AI do-dads has grown enormous, occupying 8 GB of RAM. OS bloat is why I give a rating of "4".Running Logic Pro and many audio plugins, I've never needed more than 12GB of RAM with my M1 mini. If you are doing video editing or software development, I'd recommend 24 GB RAM, and it gets expensive, $999. You might want to opt for  the M4 Pro, which comes with 24GB of RAM standard for $1399.The setup of the M4 mini is wonderful, especially if you have another M series Mac in the house. It's able to extract data for useful things as email setup from the other mac. Monitor resolution/magnification is automatic too.Apple still overcharges for hardrive space. $200 doubles the 256 GB drive to 512GB. That $200 buys an external Thunderbolt3 1TB drive, and change, which is what I did.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

    Third-party peripherals","I took my 3-year old 4K monitor and Logi wireless keyboard and mouse from my Windows box, and they worked perfectly on the Mac mini. I did have to buy a USB-A to USB-C adapter for the wireless keyboard receiver into. I made sure to buy a USB 3.1 compatible adapter, since that is what the Mac mini uses. I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear.

So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

What truly amazes me is how quiet and cool it runs, even when I'm pushing it hard. My old desktop sounded like a jet engine, but this little guy is whisper-quiet. Plus, it takes up barely any space on my desk!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

    MacOS Sequoia needs 8 GB of RAM. Meaning, only 8 GB remains for the user's activities.","No wonder the M4 comes with 16 GB of RAM standard. Glad I bought the 16 GB version of the M1 too. MacOS with AI do-dads has grown enormous, occupying 8 GB of RAM. OS bloat is why I give a rating of "4".Running Logic Pro and many audio plugins, I've never needed more than 12GB of RAM with my M1 mini. If you are doing video editing or software development, I'd recommend 24 GB RAM, and it gets expensive, $999. You might want to opt for  the M4 Pro, which comes with 24GB of RAM standard for $1399.The setup of the M4 mini is wonderful, especially if you have another M series Mac in the house. It's able to extract data for useful things as email setup from the other mac. Monitor resolution/magnification is automatic too.Apple still overcharges for hardrive space. $200 doubles the 256 GB drive to 512GB. That $200 buys an external Thunderbolt3 1TB drive, and change, which is what I did.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

    Third-party peripherals","I took my 3-year old 4K monitor and Logi wireless keyboard and mouse from my Windows box, and they worked perfectly on the Mac mini. I did have to buy a USB-A to USB-C adapter for the wireless keyboard receiver into. I made sure to buy a USB 3.1 compatible adapter, since that is what the Mac mini uses. I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear. As long as you stay with the base model, it's a deal that just can't be beat.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 Good computer","Hard to believe how good this little thing is. Extremely high single core speed. Good for emulation workloads. Totally quiet, too (the base model, don't know about the Pro CPU).

I have to say that I liked the larger case of the older Minis better. They had the on/off button on the side where it belongs, and they had space for USB-A ports.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear. As long as you stay with the base model, it's a deal that just can't be beat.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

It is truly an amazing computer.Mated to an Apple Studio Display it is this digital imager's dream computing system.I coud not recommend it more highly for imagers such as myself.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024"

I'm not processing video or doing any other heavy lifting with it. Mostly I play a couple of video games with it and I know it is overspec-ed for what I do but - so fast so smooth and just a pleasure to use. I know that most people want a Windows machine to game with and maybe they need it but the games I play on Steam work fine with this and never having to deal with Windows updates is a bonus that is hard to quantify.

    M4 Mac mini is a Beast. 24GB of Ram helps to have headroom. Because when at startup Activity Monitor is showing ram usage at about 9GB or 11GB. Having 16GB you will have only 8GB or 5Gb of headroom. Now with 24GB gives 15Gb or 13GB of headroom. So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD. Help's SSD last you longer in its Life time. Watch video for easy's way to turn  on your M4.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

It opened up my wifes silhouette program in 7 seconds and with the old 2014 macmini it took 15-20 minutes. The only issue I had was a loose HDMI port. I kept losing my connection.

I’ve read some reviews, and the biggest complaint people have is where the power button is. That’s just silly to me. If all you have to complain about when buying a new PC is the power button location, you’ve got yourself an awesome machine. I recommend this as an upgrade to anyone who has a M1 or M2 device or older. (Much less ann Intel device).  And if you’re thinking about switching from Windows to Mac? Start here.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

It’s a big beautiful YES. I LOVE the color and the screen quality is sooo smooth and pretty. I got this to replace my old one for graphic design school. I will update my review once I’ve used it a while. But so far, it’s gorgeous. Also, for my fellow Sims 4 lovers, it works amazingly well with heavy expansion pack loads. It did updates and downloads soooo fast! Get it!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

Very happy with my purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2025"

 Looks and works well","Replacing older imac, I kept my old trackpad to use instead of the mouse that came with it. I don’t like using the mouse, it’s inconvenient. I did have to buy a 3 pack of adapters that allow connecting USB-A’s to USB-C’s which also allowed connecting my older external drive to the new Mac","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"
