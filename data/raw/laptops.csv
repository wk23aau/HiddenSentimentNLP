 Best computer I ever own, and yes the base model it is more than enought.","I had this computer for two months now and it is really excellent, It is compact, powerful, beautiful designed, silent and a very good price, I bought it to edit videos in Final Cut Pro, replacing my old 2013 Mac Book Pro 15" (2000$ at that time) with a discount for 545$, It is so much faster in every task, Im even using in blender. If you are wondering if 16GB of memory and 256GB of space are ok, I can tell you it is, just buy an external SSD an you will be fine, hightly recomended.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2025"

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

What truly amazes me is how quiet and cool it runs, even when I'm pushing it hard. My old desktop sounded like a jet engine, but this little guy is whisper-quiet. Plus, it takes up barely any space on my desk!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Good computer","Hard to believe how good this little thing is. Extremely high single core speed. Good for emulation workloads. Totally quiet, too (the base model, don't know about the Pro CPU).

I have to say that I liked the larger case of the older Minis better. They had the on/off button on the side where it belongs, and they had space for USB-A ports.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

    MacOS Sequoia needs 8 GB of RAM. Meaning, only 8 GB remains for the user's activities.","No wonder the M4 comes with 16 GB of RAM standard. Glad I bought the 16 GB version of the M1 too. MacOS with AI do-dads has grown enormous, occupying 8 GB of RAM. OS bloat is why I give a rating of "4".Running Logic Pro and many audio plugins, I've never needed more than 12GB of RAM with my M1 mini. If you are doing video editing or software development, I'd recommend 24 GB RAM, and it gets expensive, $999. You might want to opt for  the M4 Pro, which comes with 24GB of RAM standard for $1399.The setup of the M4 mini is wonderful, especially if you have another M series Mac in the house. It's able to extract data for useful things as email setup from the other mac. Monitor resolution/magnification is automatic too.Apple still overcharges for hardrive space. $200 doubles the 256 GB drive to 512GB. That $200 buys an external Thunderbolt3 1TB drive, and change, which is what I did.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

    Third-party peripherals","I took my 3-year old 4K monitor and Logi wireless keyboard and mouse from my Windows box, and they worked perfectly on the Mac mini. I did have to buy a USB-A to USB-C adapter for the wireless keyboard receiver into. I made sure to buy a USB 3.1 compatible adapter, since that is what the Mac mini uses. I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear.

So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

What truly amazes me is how quiet and cool it runs, even when I'm pushing it hard. My old desktop sounded like a jet engine, but this little guy is whisper-quiet. Plus, it takes up barely any space on my desk!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

    MacOS Sequoia needs 8 GB of RAM. Meaning, only 8 GB remains for the user's activities.","No wonder the M4 comes with 16 GB of RAM standard. Glad I bought the 16 GB version of the M1 too. MacOS with AI do-dads has grown enormous, occupying 8 GB of RAM. OS bloat is why I give a rating of "4".Running Logic Pro and many audio plugins, I've never needed more than 12GB of RAM with my M1 mini. If you are doing video editing or software development, I'd recommend 24 GB RAM, and it gets expensive, $999. You might want to opt for  the M4 Pro, which comes with 24GB of RAM standard for $1399.The setup of the M4 mini is wonderful, especially if you have another M series Mac in the house. It's able to extract data for useful things as email setup from the other mac. Monitor resolution/magnification is automatic too.Apple still overcharges for hardrive space. $200 doubles the 256 GB drive to 512GB. That $200 buys an external Thunderbolt3 1TB drive, and change, which is what I did.","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024"

    Third-party peripherals","I took my 3-year old 4K monitor and Logi wireless keyboard and mouse from my Windows box, and they worked perfectly on the Mac mini. I did have to buy a USB-A to USB-C adapter for the wireless keyboard receiver into. I made sure to buy a USB 3.1 compatible adapter, since that is what the Mac mini uses. I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear. As long as you stay with the base model, it's a deal that just can't be beat.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 Good computer","Hard to believe how good this little thing is. Extremely high single core speed. Good for emulation workloads. Totally quiet, too (the base model, don't know about the Pro CPU).

I have to say that I liked the larger case of the older Minis better. They had the on/off button on the side where it belongs, and they had space for USB-A ports.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

I plugged the adapter into a spare Thunderbolt 4 port on the rear.I used an OWC 1TB Express NVMe Thunderbot external drive instead of purchasing the SDD upgrade from Apple. Spent a couple hundred dollars less and got double the storage. This enclosure is bus-powered, couldn't be simpler. Mine came pre-formatted for Apple. Truly plug and play.Before I installed any apps or migrated any data, I moved my Home folder to the external drive. Everything pinned itself there going forward, that seems to be the best way to integrate with an external drive.I simply cannot believe how well Apple has leap-frogged over Google and Microsoft with this gear. As long as you stay with the base model, it's a deal that just can't be beat.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024"

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 Excellent Value and Excellent Service. {With Edit}","I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a "save for later" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.

16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.

I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.

As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.

We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.","Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025"

 Even The Low Spec M4 is Still a Real Powerhouse","Speed demon supreme, even in the low-spec model. 27" iMac if connected with Thunderbolt and if using an 8K dummy monitor plug works wonderfully well as a monitor for a headless M4 mini -- using screen sharing. The ride for setup is a bit bumpy to get that all working, but the results are great -- not for gaming or full screen 5k+ video, but otherwise, terrific. An astonishing difference rendering a Rhino 8 drawing on the M4 compared to an i7 iMac (not really practical on the i7 at all). Data transfer speed is wonderful, as expected. This is a really good headless way to get some M4 goodness while keeping the familiar old Intel apps alive until they are fully exterminated by the poison apple policy. Be sure to get the top-flight best USB-C cables you can buy, as the cheaper ones don't work.

I was very skeptical, and also reluctant. And these days, a five star is not easily given. But, I have to admit, this is a lot of computer for the money. I bought this machine to be a little automation hub, tucked away in obsurity for meanial tasks. After setting it up and kicking the tires, it's now a programming ambassador to the M4 world, and the door to the next world of Apple. A worthwhile purchase as Apple things go.

Buying the monitor and more storage, etc. will be painful but worthwhile. I'm already thinking about whether I should wait longer for the 30" iMac M4/M5/M? - and leaning that way, but the prospect of another Mini with the separate monitor is nice.

In principle, I should knock one or two stars for the non-upgradable RAM and non-upgradable storage, and maybe another star for privacy and obsolesence issues, but I'm keeping the 5 star rating for value and the path forward for those of us who are in the Apple camp for until something better comes along. I spent years deep in the driver and update hell of Windows before switching to the smoother Apple world. Apple is now so mature that it takes a good day to fully grind through cleansing and setting up the mini for legitimate use... tools, firewalling, filtering, and more -- but once there, it's impressive. Don't get me wrong, most people will be happy in minutes.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

 Hardware fast; setup slow; PowerButton solved!","The raw speed of CPU, GPU, and Unified Memory is race-car fast; but it took me half a day to get from unboxing to my desktop, and I met some usability problems.

After the Hello dialog and choosing language and keyboard, then Setup recommended upgrading from MacOS 15.0 to 15.1. This is expected for a new product: the software must be frozen in order to manufacture the flood of units for initial shipment to distributors, so purchasers of those units should expect the equivalent of a few months of software updates. With my gigabit network connection,
it took only a couple minutes to download a few GB. But the first progress bar for Preparing the upgrade said "About 30 minutes remaining", and that was an optimistic estimate. Steady state was not reached for almost one hour.

Setup finally finished, and then I started Migration Assistant. I had 200GB on a 3-year old MacMini-M1 with MacOS 12.6 (Monterey), connected to the new machine with a Thunderbolt 3 cable made by Apple. By clicking around during the transfer, I learned that the Assistant had diagnosed the hardware connection as more than 10 GB/s, with other options (including 1 Gb/s wired connections to the same ethernet switch) down to ad-hoc WiFi network at 54 Mb/s.

After waiting for a couple minutes of "Looking for files to migrate", I decided that it would never actually Connect. (That's bad U/I for not being more informative.) So I Back'ed up all the way to the beginning, and started again. This time the machines connected, and after a 6-digit numeric handshake the transfer began. The end-to-end speed meter generally indicated 50 MB/s to 85 MB/s; 200 GB took
more than an hour.

Next, Usability: At 7.5 inches square, I rested a 1920x1080 monitor on top of a previous generation MacMini with no problem. The new generation is only 5 inches square, and the combination is tippy.
Then the ports: DisplayPort remains a second-class connection: you must use AltMode, a USB-C port, and an active adapter (more than just wires); I don't like that. The lack of a USB-A port is a poor choice.
$5 for an adapter (USB-A socket to USB-C plug). Many an older USB-2.0 mouse, keyboard, tablet, etc. continues to work just fine. "Get a new device with Bluetooth" requires a purchase and a battery, whieh is not eco-friendly. If you want to connect a USB video camera, multi-channel audio device (digital sound output and/or input), CD/DVD player/recorder, etc, then you will need a powered USB hub (USB-2.0 works); and probably TWO of them: one on the back, one on the front. Then an external SSD via USB-3.2 and USB-C brings the usage of Thunderbolt ports to 4: front USB hub (for convenience of U/I devices and USB flash memory), rear USB hub, DisplayPort, SSD.

Finally, the Power button. Assume that Sleep consumes 3.5 Watts, which is the EPA limit. There are 720 hours in one month, so that's 2.5 kWh per month, or 30 kWh per year. At the US residential average
of $0.18 per gross kilowatt hour (total bill divided by total usage), that's $5.44 per year, which buys a nice ice cream cone. That's the cost of Sleep instead of PowerOff; de-rate for your estimated average daily sleep duration. Having the Power button on the bottom costs you that ice cream cone. The solution: stand the MacMini on its side, with the power cord near the bottom edge; see photo. Now the Power button is reachable at top rear. Also, get a vertical stand to guard against tipping, like the ones made for "1 liter PC" (approx. 7 x 7 x 1.5 inches) by Lenovo.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024"

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    M4 is great, but step up to 24Gb memory and 512TB SSD","If you are thinking of replacing an old iMac with another more up-to-date machine, consider getting a Mac Mini M4, period. I angsted for weeks over replacing my 2015 27" iMac with something newer. The OS on the iMac could not be updated any longer, and I was receiving notices that my goto app, Fusion 360, would no longer work on the existing machine as of March, 2025. The telling blow came when I downloaded Turbo Tax 2024 without checking its OS requirements. It required Apple silicon also. After much reading of reviews it was evident that the base Mac Mini (16Gb memory and 256 TB SSD) would not be the best choice. Of course you will need to buy a display, but after using a HD monitor it was evident that a higher res monitor was needed if you expected to have the display equal my old iMac. A 5k ASUS monitor arrives this coming Saturday.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024"

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

It is truly an amazing computer.Mated to an Apple Studio Display it is this digital imager's dream computing system.I coud not recommend it more highly for imagers such as myself.","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2024"

I'm not processing video or doing any other heavy lifting with it. Mostly I play a couple of video games with it and I know it is overspec-ed for what I do but - so fast so smooth and just a pleasure to use. I know that most people want a Windows machine to game with and maybe they need it but the games I play on Steam work fine with this and never having to deal with Windows updates is a bonus that is hard to quantify.

    M4 Mac mini is a Beast. 24GB of Ram helps to have headroom. Because when at startup Activity Monitor is showing ram usage at about 9GB or 11GB. Having 16GB you will have only 8GB or 5Gb of headroom. Now with 24GB gives 15Gb or 13GB of headroom. So this is MORE better for stoping spindump when you are using more Larger DATA Transfer , photo's and music files and such. Also if you have more ram less wright and read back to SSD. Help's SSD last you longer in its Life time. Watch video for easy's way to turn  on your M4.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025"

It opened up my wifes silhouette program in 7 seconds and with the old 2014 macmini it took 15-20 minutes. The only issue I had was a loose HDMI port. I kept losing my connection.

I’ve read some reviews, and the biggest complaint people have is where the power button is. That’s just silly to me. If all you have to complain about when buying a new PC is the power button location, you’ve got yourself an awesome machine. I recommend this as an upgrade to anyone who has a M1 or M2 device or older. (Much less ann Intel device).  And if you’re thinking about switching from Windows to Mac? Start here.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

It’s a big beautiful YES. I LOVE the color and the screen quality is sooo smooth and pretty. I got this to replace my old one for graphic design school. I will update my review once I’ve used it a while. But so far, it’s gorgeous. Also, for my fellow Sims 4 lovers, it works amazingly well with heavy expansion pack loads. It did updates and downloads soooo fast! Get it!","Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2024"

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

Very happy with my purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2025"

 Looks and works well","Replacing older imac, I kept my old trackpad to use instead of the mouse that came with it. I don’t like using the mouse, it’s inconvenient. I did have to buy a 3 pack of adapters that allow connecting USB-A’s to USB-C’s which also allowed connecting my older external drive to the new Mac","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024"

 Great deal on a great laptop","My mother’s 8 year old MacBook has begun to get sluggish, so I’ve been looking for a replacement. This one was just what she needed. She’s 79, so she doesn’t need all the bells and whistles. This MacBook Air is perfect for her. We very easily migrated the data from her old MacBook and she was up and running in no time.","Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2024"

 A terrific daily driver","Goes well with Anker 547 USB-C Hub (7-in-2) and Cable Matters USB C to DisplayPort 1.4 Cable if you have a 5K@144Hz monitor (in my case an LG UltraGear+ 49"). Performs notably faster than the M1, has the break-away power port that's always saved my bacon, 16 GB of RAM (yes, this does make a difference for me), and the SSD is fast enough that I didn't see any purpose upgrading storage.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    All around excellent","I was torn between the M2 and M3 MacBooks but decided I wanted to save the $100 and get the M2, since I’m not doing anything too crazy. This really has been such an excellent laptop. My first new Mac in 14 years,the battery lasts a very long time, screen and sound quality are great, comfortable to use. I did have to get an adapter for other ports since it only has USB C but I honestly use it very rarely. Hoping it lasts as long as my previous Mac!","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better!

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Good purchase.","This is my second time owning this specific laptop I absolutely love it, if you’re a sims player get this!! It runs smooth without the laptop running hot. It is good on battery life depending on how often you use it. It is a nice size not to big not to small but compact and comfortable enough to tote around. It is quiet and doesn’t run loud. Set up was super easy . You also get all the updates that the newer iPhones get 15 and up models .","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack.

However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 The Perfect Balance of Power and Portability","The MacBook Air M2 with 16GB RAM is an outstanding laptop. It handles multitasking and demanding tasks like video editing effortlessly. The battery life is exceptional, easily lasting a full day, and the lightweight design makes it perfect for on-the-go use.

The Liquid Retina display is stunning, and the keyboard and trackpad are top-notch. While the limited ports require an adapter for peripherals, the overall performance, sleek design, and future-proofing make this a fantastic investment.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

They had never used a Mac before, but had used iPads, and had a small learning curve for these and were quickly comfortable using them on a daily basis.

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better!

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    the best deal to get macOS AND Windows in your bag.","M3 / 16gb macbook air with full 1 yr apple warranty for hundreds less. Came factory sealed in original packaging. With my usage - about 2 hours a day - i charge it less than once a week.Installed VMware Fusion (free) and Windows 11 for ARM and now have both environments in a very long lasting and super portable package. Even with windows running and giving 8gb to both OS'es, I do not feel any sluggishness on either side. Having no fan means I dont have to worry about sitting it on my lap.","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2025"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver.

I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

    Awesome deal! Battery life is great!","Bought this one during Black Friday deals and it works great. Had to replace my old Macbook as the screen and battery was becoming faulty. In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    LOVE My MacBook","This is my first MacBook and I LOVE it. I've never had a MacBook before and when I first started using it I was very frustrated. It definitely takes some getting used to, but now I love it. Automatically syncs from my iPhone and I love the finger print feature that signs me into any account. I'm really glad I went with the 13 inch option because it's big enough without being bulky.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

 Nice laptop","I bought this laptop this past November and am very happy with it. I upgraded from the M1 Airbook and have no regrets.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    I'm not techy but...","I adore this computer. I was on the fence about upgrading from my still functioning buy terrible battery life, comparable 2018 version. I'm SO glad I did. I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy. Helps me distinguish mine from others with same laptop in the classic color.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    Mi primer Macbook, excelente experiencia!","mas de 20 años usando windows y este año decidí pasarme al ecosistema de apple. No ha sido una transición fácil, los comandos y las costumbres marcan, sin embargo los beneficios han sido muy notorios:Inicio inmediato del sistema, ningún lag pese a que uso múltiples exploradores y programas al tiempo, imagen impecable, muy buena duración de batería, excelente integración con tu iPhone, conectividad perfecta.Sobre el color, es muy elegante y me ha gustado mucho, con los case combina muy bien y no molesta para las huellas sobre el material.Por mejorar podría ser el material de las teclas que asume un desgaste de huella prematuro y se va viendo brillante, aunque veo que es fácil y económico comprarlas y cambiarlas con los años.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

The 16 GB ram is superb for users who are just browsing the web, using this machine for work, watching videos, etc. If you are dependent for heavier workloads consider either the 24 GB RAM model or a base MacBook Pro. Right now the RAM is being used around 8-10 GB out of 16 GB. So thankful apple upgraded their RAM to 16 GB for free.

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver.

I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

Powered by m3, it delivers impressive speed, very efficient and enhanced graphics, making multi tasking seamless. It has stunned liquid retina display with vibrant colors. The battery last up to 18hrs and it is ideal for on-the-go use. This is definitely worth it!!!","Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy. Helps me distinguish mine from others with same laptop in the classic color.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    Mac Air high quality laptop","Mac is such a high quality laptop.  Even the way it is received in such quality packaging.  I love that they last forever and don’t get viruses.  I love the 15.3 large size screen and keyboard.  There are 4 colors now and lots of accessory options.  I got one for my daughter her senior year for school.  Now 8 years later she is using it for her at home business.  No slow downs or issues at all.","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

I'll add an external hard drive or find another way to connect it to my extensive music collection.  Now I have a computer to travel with if I want.

I was hesitant at first, because I was so comfortable with PCs and laptops. Well, my family was right — I should have made the switch to a Mac years ago.

I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

I've bought a $400 Dell laptop for myself as just a test machine and it has all the ports you'd expect on a laptop. I had to buy my wife a usb-c dong which is ridiculous. At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple. My son's new laptop I have upgraded and it's great.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

I was happy that Apple had 15” MacBook Air because I needed the bigger screen but not the extra tech of a Pro. The notebook works great and the transfer of data from one the old to the new was simple. Also it was a great deal as I got it during the Black Friday specials. Love the thinness and size of the computer and the battery life is amazing. Should last me another 8-9 years which is why I moved to Mac anyway.

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience. And overall, love how this Macbook Air fits into my life!After receiving my new Macbook, I ended up investing in the Apple Care+ yearly subscription for peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 This was a good deal for a great laptop. Delivered promptly as well.","I was shopping around for a good deal on a MacBook.

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny.

Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    Easy conversion","My conversion to Mac from being a lifelong Windows user was fantastic.  After putting off the transition for years, I made the leap and very happy with ease of use with the MacBook Air. It's so sweet not having all kinds of Windows patches to apply and rebooting all the time.The MacBook costs more than a Windows machine, but the fact that one can use it without all the fuss and interruptions of rebooting provides more value.  So far after a month I have done zero rebooting and 100 percent computing.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

The notebook works great and the transfer of data from one the old to the new was simple. Also it was a great deal as I got it during the Black Friday specials. Love the thinness and size of the computer and the battery life is amazing. Should last me another 8-9 years which is why I moved to Mac anyway.

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience. And overall, love how this Macbook Air fits into my life!After receiving my new Macbook, I ended up investing in the Apple Care+ yearly subscription for peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

 Great laptop and much improved design.","Super slim. Long battery life. Huge screen for 15 inch models. Lots of room on the keyboard. Great value for a MacBook Air. Quality is great.

 Excellent performance and battery life","A great first Mac for a life-long Windows user. I love the slick Mac OS, quality hardware, excellent performance, and long battery life. Easy setup and transfer of content from my previous computer. Tight integration with iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods enhances the experience. The ultra-thin and lightweight form-factor will be great for travel as well. Like with iPhone, there is no bloatware cluttering the computer for an optimal user experience.","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

 Incredible Machine","Beautiful hardware inside and out. Lightweight and portable but still incredibly smooth and fast. The latest MacOs runs flawlessly on this MacBook.

It has no issues keeping up with me and jumping between VS code, logic, safari, email, etc. handles anything you throw at it.

I haven’t tried any video editing, but I did play a bit of Civilization 6 and it runs great.

Battery life is phenomenal as with all the apple silicon.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024"

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience. And overall, love how this Macbook Air fits into my life!After receiving my new Macbook, I ended up investing in the Apple Care+ yearly subscription for peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Very nice computer","Let me start by saying I am not Apple's biggest fan - I've always used Dell or HP machines so this one has been a bit of a learning curve for me.  With that being said, I am really impressed with this laptop.  My daughter and I are the media team at our church where we are responsible for creating announcement videos and presentation slides.  The graphics are super clear and the processing speed is amazing.  There is no waiting for software to open and having multiple programs open doesn't slow it down.  We purchased a monitor and dock with this machine and it has turned out to be a great system.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.

    Replacing a Macbook","Very happy to make this purchase at a discounted price over the holidays.  I bought this to replace an old Macbook Pro I had at a secondary property.  I'v always bought 13 inch Macbooks but went with the 15 inch on this.I'm just using it for the web.  I'll add an external hard drive or find another way to connect it to my extensive music collection.  Now I have a computer to travel with if I want.  The Macbook Pro I replaced was 2012/2013 that no longer received updates and became very slow.","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2025"

I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    It's fine","It's fine for a laptop. My wife is in the Mac eco system and she needed a new one. I gave it 3 start because it only comes with 2 usb-c ports and nothing else. I've bought a $400 Dell laptop for myself as just a test machine and it has all the ports you'd expect on a laptop. I had to buy my wife a usb-c dong which is ridiculous. At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple. My son's new laptop I have upgraded and it's great.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

It has no issues keeping up with me and jumping between VS code, logic, safari, email, etc. handles anything you throw at it.

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    Loving it","So far I am loving my MacBook. I haven’t had an Apple computer in a bit. I didn’t think it would be different from my phone. There are some things to adjust to but nothing too difficult. I love the screen size and I especially love the battery life. Game changer in my opinion. I worried a little about shipping but that was smooth and required a signature. Very pleased.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024"

    EASILY REPLACED MY MACBOOK PRO","I have always  purchased MacBook Pro's since I switched to Apple in 2006.

    Always Good","I have used Apple notebooks for a long time and they never disappoint. This is an upgrade to a 9 year old MacBook Pro that still works great but can no longer be upgraded. I was happy that Apple had 15” MacBook Air because I needed the bigger screen but not the extra tech of a Pro. The notebook works great and the transfer of data from one the old to the new was simple. Also it was a great deal as I got it during the Black Friday specials. Love the thinness and size of the computer and the battery life is amazing. Should last me another 8-9 years which is why I moved to Mac anyway. Never had a PC last more than 2-3 years.","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024"

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience. And overall, love how this Macbook Air fits into my life!After receiving my new Macbook, I ended up investing in the Apple Care+ yearly subscription for peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    Great laptop","Replaced my 8 year old Macbook Pro with this one. 15” is the perfect size for me. Easy setup. Fairly easy transfer of data, etc. from my old laptop. I got the black one which shows smudges more than my old space gray one, but no biggie.  Much faster than my old one, and it’s nice to have good battery life again. Highly recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2024"

At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple.

 Fabulous, of course!","This is the first new laptop I've bought since 2013, to replace my mini 11" MacBook Air that isn't being sold anymore (I'll be using that one at the office, as it's still going strong...I can no longer update its operating system). This discounted M2 model, plus the discount on AppleCare, made it a no-brainer for the Prime Day sale. It's quick, responsive, light and compact, holds a charge for a very long time, and I'm very happy with it. I did have to get a C-to-USB adapter to accommodate my old thumb drives. No biggie.

 Well built, portable, aesthetically pleasing","I needed a laptop to separate work from personal activities. I thought about getting a Chromebook, but the ones reported to have better build quality were almost as expensive as Windows and Mac laptops. When the MacBook Air M2 went on clearance sale, I jumped on it. I use a MacBook for work, so it is a plus not having to keep two systems in mind. I had seen concerns in reviews about 8 GB memory being insufficient, but I find it very responsive for my light use: email, web browsing, some word processing and watching videos. I don't play video games or do video editing. The screen is nice and big enough for me, and the keyboard has a nice solid feel. Battery life is more than good enough for a machine that I mostly use at home.","Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2024"

 Great for mobile computing","I purchased this base model Macbook Air M2 for attending online courses through a university. I've been mainly a Windows PC user for a while now. My last Macbook was an old 12-inch Macbook Pro G4 (remember those mini-me/Yow Ming commercials?).

After being able to use this laptop for a couple of months, I've decided that given the current state of technology within my home, my future personal computers will most likely be all Apple, as long as I continue to use iPhones, AppleTVs and Apple Accessories (such as AirPods). The current form of the MacOS allows easy use of printers/scanners and any other computer peripheral you may need.

With all that said, I will say that you should consider this base model for the following reasons:
- You currently have an Apple ecosystem.
- You need a lightweight, small form-factor laptop for basic computing needs.
- You primarily run cloud-based platforms that don't require local storage.
- You'd like to work "unplugged" for many hours without having to charge the laptop.
- You enjoy a bright monitor and a pretty decent keyboard to type on.

At the same time, I would NOT recommend this model if you need the following:
- You'll be running large programs that require a lot of local storage.
- You require a machine that will process/render high-resolution media. The lack of a fan will cause the Macbook to thermal throttle, lowering your performance. For a little more, you're better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.
- Gaming (Thermal throttle will lower framerates).

A few honorable mentions:
- Despite the lack of larger, more visible speakers, the sound is decent for this category of laptop.
- The low power requirements make this an easy travel laptop, not requiring that you bring a huge brick to keep this thing going.
- The redesigned look is a lot nicer than the previous generation (I'm glad the wedge design is gone).

Finally, regarding value:
Considering where we are in tech today, I feel that for the money, we should no longer have base models with only 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD space. At the very least, I really hope that Apple would consider making their base models start at 16GB of Ram and 512GB of SSD storage without increasing the price. At the very least, if they keep the 256GB of SSD, give the option to keep an SD card on board without having to attach an external drive every time you want expanded storage.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2022"

 Excellent","This was an transition version of the Ipad Air...it has the M1 vs M2 or M4 chip. And, it came with only 64MB of storage. It has a 10.9" screen, which seems about the same as the 11".
For me, this combo and a very low price worked very well. However, I can see that I am approaching the 64MB limit a bit faster than I expected. So, with this machine you do need to be aware of storage.
Beyond that, it runs great, and might be a real bargain for someone who can live with limited storage and a fast chip.","Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2024"

 You can't go wrong with the Mac!!","This is my second Macbook. I bought my first Mac laptop in 2014 after being so frustrated with having to battle all the virus' and failed spyware on my 1 year old Dell laptop. I spent the same amount on Spyware/Norton Antivirus subscriptions year after year as I would have buying a new Macbook. I used that Macbook Air for over 8 years before having to have it serviced...no pop ups, no virus issues, super fast processor. I bought a cheap HP to save some money and I regret it. It was time for another Macbook Air. As expected...it's a fantastic laptop. If you've never used a Mac laptop it takes some getting used to.

I sat them side by side and ran the same programs.. the MBA 2022 beat the MBP 2017 every time.. That's not saying the MBP is not a great computer I used it for 5 years.  I even now it is a great computer for pro tasks.. because it is very cheap.. you can buy my 2017 on Amazon for about $450.. ya that's right.. and I took the $150 discount on Amazon for the new MBA.. It was well worth it..  this sucker is fast !!  You can get a 30 day return policy from some vendors,, I suggest you try it if your not a supper power user.. and you will have the latest M2 chip and OS!  Apple will eventually drop the intel compatibility to move forward.. it could be next year or 3 years,. but they will move forward..

    Dont know why I waited so long to purchase this amazing laptop","Purchased this on sale to replace a 11+ year old OG 15 inch Macbook Pro Retina, which still works perfectly despite the battery not holding a charge long. I tend to keep laptops for a long time and wanted to stay with Apple due to my experience with my last one. I waited on the M2 version for its upgrades over the M1, which I read is also a great computer. Love how fast it is, very snappy, and the specs are perfect for my heavy home office use. Setup was a breeze from an iCloud backup. Have used it on multiple Zoom and Teams video meetings and the new camera and speakers work awesome for this purpose. Hope this one lasts as long as the Mac Pro!","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023"

    Mostly has been great","I liked this laptop more than I expected, as a replacement for my 2012 macbook air.  This laptop is much more powerful, light, sleek, and the keyboard is great.  I was hesitant to move away from the 2012 mac air keyboard, but so far it has been great.  My only gripe is that, when closed, the lid is slightly not lining up with the base.  It is off very slightly, like .5mm or so, but it is noticeable if I run my finger down the edge.  It is a small negative, but for the price of this product, and the expectation that you are getting a premium product, it is a disappointment.  I would give the product a 4.5 because of this, but I can only choose 4 or 5","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2023"

    Air Review","I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact. My previous Macs have been indestructible so this change must be from the new construction. I was told there's no way to prevent the same damage to the trackpad in the future which makes me relatively concerned about ongoing cost if the same problem continues to occur. I would purchase an older, more durable model before this one, or be sure to get AppleCare+ because they aren't quite made to last as they used to be! Without these issues it would be a great computer, it's fast, light, portable, and holds long battery life, but the constant need to get costly repairs just doesn't offset it!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2022"

    Buying a base model mac with only 8GB of ram is a terrible mistake","It's practically criminal that Apple gets away with hamstringing it's base models with so little RAM. The first MBA I bought in 2011 had that much memory in it. Anyone who uses more that one browser tab or app at a time is going to be in a world of spinning beachball pain. It's also gross that Apple charges $200 just to upgrade to 16GB. But there is no way around it, you really need 16 (or better 24+GB) or you are going to regret it. Macbook Airs are great machines, that will last you a long time, but not if you buy the base model! The base model pricing is also just a lie. Consider that you need to spend at least $200 more then comparison shop before you decide if you are still getting a good enough deal with Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2024"

Email, web browsing, photo uploads and simple editing. This computer handles it no problemo.  I have also used iMovie to edit and export DJI Mini 3 Pro footage, and I really haven't noticed a huge battery suck with that.  The screen is bright and crisp, the keyboard is precise, and the battery life is exceptional.  USB-C cord allows me to charge from wall outlets and battery packs, another game changer.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Fast and very capable computer","I bought this MacBook Air to replace my old 2011 model. I considered buying an M3 model, but this one costs a lot less. Also, having experienced with 4GB Ram and 128 GB storage, I decided to go with the 16 GB Ram and 512 GB storage. I was not disappointed! This Mac is fast! The 2011 model served me well for 13 years, and I sure believe this one will do as well.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better!

    Amazing battery life backed up by an amazing hardware experience","I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding. Cannot recommend this thing enough. Great job Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022"

    2022 M2 Shipped for repairs twice in first 6 months. Same problem. Many, many hours lost.","I'm glad to see that many others have had a good experience. Not me. I purchased the new MacBook Air M2 on 12-15-23. Worked fine for about two months. Then, the cursor would freeze for no apparent reason. Had to constantly restart. Of course the Amazon return window closed. Spent hours on the phone with Apple Care techs. Drove 40 miles to an Apple Store. They shipped it in for repairs. It was shipped to my home a few days later with a repair document indicating the Track Pad had been replaced. At this time it would work until you open and close the lid. The cursor would be frozen. Several more sessions with Apple Care techs. They shipped me a box. I boxed it up and shipped it out with a long note indicating the problem. It was returned to me 2 days later with a document indicating they had replaced the lid angle sensor. Still the same problem. Had an hour long session with an Apple Care tech last  weekend that got disconnected and another one today that suggested I try connecting a mouse to see if the problem persists to rule out the Track Pad. Although all of the shipping and repairs have so far been covered by the original Apple warranty, I'm still out for hours and hours spent trying to get it working. Plus out $1,200.00 for the original purchase. Have two other MacBook Airs (2014 & 2015) and never had a problem with either one and they have both traveled literally around the country multiple times.

Took the laptop to Apple service center and they said it has display hardware problem and requires replacement.This is a piece of garbage which did not go through proper quality control in their manufacturing process and we have to suffer through. This is highly unacceptable.

    Great Laptop for the price","I have wanted a MacBook for a while just for watching movies, YouTube videos, and doing basic internet stuff anywhere instead of being stuck at my desk. Decided to pull the trigger with this sale that is currently going on.I love the look and feel of the laptop, its super light, and the battery last a while. The only thing I wish it had was a 120hz display. If it did, it would literally be perfect for the money.I used to own a MacBook, switched to PC, so I was already pretty familiar with how they work, but if you are coming from PC there can be a learning curve.Overall, it's a great machine for doing the basic stuff I mentioned earlier.

    Absurdly Frail Piece of Garbage","This is the worst computer I have ever owned in a lifetime as a Mac user. The problem is the Retina display will shatter if you so much as tap it with a feather, and represents a huge step back in quality vs previous designs. Older MacBooks had a nice sturdy band of plastic or metal surrounding the display that helped make it more durable. The last one I owned went all over the world with me without a hitch. There is no point in owning a laptop so fragile that you can’t take it anywhere. I would rather that it were heavier and less pretty if that made it more durable.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025"

    First Mac -- Blown Away","I've long been a PC user, built my own pretty decent gaming rig a few years ago. I recently enrolled in school and decided I needed something portable. After reading reviews, I decided that this was the way to go.I've used Windows my entire life and never really gave the idea of MacOS a thought, but I absolutely love it. It has some similarities to Linux, which I've used in the past. It syncs flawlessly to other Apple products (I already had the iPhone and AirPods,) which is really cool. I love using Messenger on my computer, a feature I never knew I needed.As for the hardware, it's solid. The unit itself is very light, but still feels incredibly sturdy. My main complaint is how easily the surface smudges -- a minor issue. I just got a clear clamshell case for mine and it looks good without smudging. I don't use the camera much but I did play around with it for a little bit and it looks great. The keyboard is pretty much silent and the touchpad is nice, took a little getting used to coming from Windows but I figured it out after a few hours of use. The thumbprint touch pad works great and is super convenient. The display is gorgeous, incredibly rich colors and great contrast.Overall, a great purchase. I was a little scared to go all-in and jump into MacOS, but I don' t have any regrets at all. I'd even consider getting an iMac now. Super impressed with the hardware, software and everything else on this machine. Highly recommend, even at MSRP.","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2023"

My only issue, and why I reviewed it for 4 stars, is in my first couple days of using it, it already scratched. I am very careful with it, so when I discovered a scratch that will not come off, I was very disappointed. I tried using toothpaste and water to get it off, but it has not done the trick. So please be careful when you buy this product, because like I said, it gets scratches very easily and they do not come off.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Good purchase.","This is my second time owning this specific laptop I absolutely love it, if you’re a sims player get this!! It runs smooth without the laptop running hot. It is good on battery life depending on how often you use it. It is a nice size not to big not to small but compact and comfortable enough to tote around. It is quiet and doesn’t run loud. Set up was super easy . You also get all the updates that the newer iPhones get 15 and up models .","Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack.

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better! Now I don't have a computer for a week.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025"

 First impression on Starlight.","I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.
The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.
The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.
The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboard
is about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.
Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.
Multi-tasking / browsing / usage
Some sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.
Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.
And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2022"

 Literally just buy this. I’m a teacher and I have to have a dependable laptop.","The size is a perfect fit for my work bag. I bought this for my job, constant training online classes and zoom. The battery life is excellent. I can go two days without charging. The power up speed is faster than I expected. The ease of being able to switch between different screens is mind blowing.

 A Very Good Purchase","The MacBook Air M2 is a great laptop, with a fast chip and slim profile. Battery life is good. I bought the 13”, which is fine for my purposes. It arrived in perfect condition, and the champagne color is nice. I was worried that the champagne would be pinkish, but it’s really more silver, which I like. I wish Apple would put the USB-C ports on the right side instead of the left, making it easier to plug in a wired mouse when I use it at my desk.

 A reliable and capable laptop","I've had the Apple 2022 MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip for a few weeks now and overall, I'm pretty happy with it. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display is really nice, the colors are vibrant and the screen is super sharp. The 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage are plenty for what I need, which is mostly just browsing the web, checking email, and working on documents.

The Backlit Keyboard is a nice touch, it's really helpful when I'm working in low light. And the 1080p FaceTime HD Camera is great for video calls with family and friends.

I also like that it works seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad, it's really convenient to be able to start something on one device and pick it up where I left off on another.

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit pricey, and I'm not sure if it's totally worth it for what I use it for. But overall, it's a great laptop and I'm happy with my purchase. Also, the Starlight color is really pretty, it's a nice change from the usual silver or black.","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024"

    I am so in love with this laptop -","I have dreamt of owning a MacBook since they came out. Even one of the square little Apple computers from 2006- anything. I am so overjoyed that AMAZON had the option to finance with 0% interest. I honestly was nervous buying this off Amazon- I'm not incentivized to make a review and I barely do- but Im eager to make sure anyone reading knows my excitement is genuine to the core and you need to do yourself the favor of purchasing this computer. I've used various chromebooks and HPs after being gifted a friends old 2013 MacBook that had water damage (it literally lasted me 4 years!!) and nothing ever compared.  Especially for business, I'm an artist and the frustration and time it used to take to email myself photos to use on my website was terrible. Being able to have my iPhone merg with my computer has already saved me hundreds of hours since receiving this macbook 2 weeks ago. I'm so happy. Its so fast and has everything you need. I truly don't think there's many reasons to get any other versions other than the 13 if you are tight on funds and need something efficient and fast.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2024"

    Nothing like its hype!","I am 61 years old. I never got into the "Apple" hype. One of my kids did. Yet, I always wanted to try "one Apple" product. I bought this MacBook Air 2 on sale. I am so dissapointed. It came to me dead on arrival, zero battery which is actually super hard to accomplish. The setup was, to me, very challenging, between the actual computer and your "Apple" account. I was locked out for 48 hours and spent hours with Apple customer services. Even they couldn't understand why any of the troubles. Once I got it going, it is about "half" as slow or useless as my $100.00 Lenovo Chromebook.I think Apple runs on Mystic fumes. In reality, in the real world, Apple is left in the dust of Android machines. I can't return my macBook. Too late.

    Very robust equipment!","I was an heavy user of a 2015 12 inches Macbook. That's one of the best computer in the world. Every job coleague bought one after the experience on my Mac.I can't put 5 stars o the new M2 Air model. It's heavier and bigger than my original Mac. And it appears like a conventional laptop. But the main problem is the time life of Apple products in general. I have an older Dell notebook in my office and it has no problems with recent Windows version. Apple doesn't support their products more than seven or eight years. It's impossible or very expansive to replace battery or to fix keyboard.In the end of the day, the initial low investment will increase because you must replace your Mac sooner than other Windows equipment.I'm considering to give up from Apple after this M2. I'm using a Samsung tablet and it has a longer life than Ipad. The same happens to my cell phone. But I'll miss the Mac robustness against virus: if something appear (rarely) you only need to reboot the Mac.","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022"

    My Favorite","I really, really love this computer. I bought it because my old Air bit the dust, and knew I wanted another to replace it. The only difference that I genuinely noticed between this new computer and my old one is the sensitivity of the mouse pad. It took a few days for me to adapt to this new mouse pad, but once I did, I had no issues. Battery life is fantastic. I can easily spend all day on my computer and still have battery power the next day. The cord is also made of a flexible material, whereas the cord with my older computer was a rubber-bound wire, which had started to fray where it connected to the battery. This new material they use won't fray like my old one, as it is much more adaptable to being wrapped up.","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2023"

    Apple Silicon Day is here!","I am going to go about this one a little differently.  There are tons of reviews and information on the Macbook Air out there.  No point in repeating them or disputing them, after all they are someone's point of view. I am going to come at this as a window user and a skeptic.First I heard about the Apple Silicon back when Apple debuted the M1 chip.  I think anyone that is being honest has to admit this is impressive.  The battery life and performance combo is great.  As a windows user who has never owned a macbook and who thought the Macbook Air was unattractive was not going to jump ship over the M1.  I do not like Apple's walled garden approach to their products.  I still thought the under 1k starting price was impressive for what you get.Fast forward to 2022 and Apple redesigned the Air and updated their M1 chip now calling it M2. I decided now I was going to purchase my first Macbook ( a small sale helped as well).Initial out of box experience was not great.  I bought the starlight color because I am tired of so many boring PC colors out there and when taking it out of the box it looked more silver.  I have long had a problem with AppleID (using Apple TV+) and had to revisit this frustration again. The update took over 30 minutes (Hello windows).  The trackpad was awful to use. Of course there was the whole unfamiliarity with MacOS as well.My second day was much better though.  I found how to adjust the haptic touchpad.  I became more familiar with the OS.  During the daytime the Laptop had a more light gold look to it. I downloaded google drive and Edge.  I was generally feeling better about my purchase.  Below are my thoughts.Reality:  The battery life and performance claims are slightly exaggerated. The battery life is good but to hit this high numbers you have to use it a certain way.  Using Edge browser for instance, with google drive enabled does produce a battery life in the 9-10 hour range that is well within some windows devices range.  Performance is real though with this being the fastest device to open ESPN website which is notoriously more demanding than most.The build quality is great with a sturdy feel and yet still thin enough. Most of the time it appears with a lot of manufactures you get one or the other (build quality or weight).Myth:  The display is really nice, but not any amazing OMG nice.  Plenty of other laptop makers have better displays.  Also while I thought the 2020 Air was unattractive because of its chunky bezels, the bezels on the 2022 model could still be shrunken on the side a little more. The notch does not bother me in the least.Myth 2: Windows laptops are obsolete?  No, there are better looking window devices out there that have better screens and a better design. Also you can find them a good bit less expensive when on sale.  The issue is most of them struggle to put forth such a complete package.Value:  I know they increased the price by $200 which is a lot without them increasing the base specs to match.  I got the base model and I am aware of the single nand performance of the 256 SSD. It is not as big of an issue as some make out and for everyday people (basic computer needs) it is meaningless.  I got my model on sale for 1099 total with taxes (sale with pay for the taxes promotion).  I feel that is a good price for the specs.  What I am not okay with is the absurd pricing that occurs once you add in more storage and memory.  This will quickly go up.  Just my viewpoint but whenever a non-gaming pc costs more than a powerful gaming pc it is too much.  Keep it $1200 or less for this one.MacOS: still learning it, so I won’t say yeah or nay on it just yet, but it is a different animal to windows. I do not like the way to activate the backlit keyboard, as there is no shortcut key, and it has to be activated through a menu.Conclusion:  There is a very short list of devices that hit it on all the critical parts of a device and the 2022 Macbook Air M2 does it. My understanding is that Apple keeps their design language the same for a while so buying this model you should not have to worry about a big redesign making this one feel dated anytime soon.Competition:  The Macbook Pro itself would be something to consider if you want more performance but the same OS and build quality.  Windows has quite a few competitors with the HP Spectre, Dell XPS, Lenovo Yoga, Asus Zenbook, and I am confident the Surface Laptop 5 will be a stunner with good performance, battery life, and 120hz refresh rate.Why is the MA2 a top choice for most everyday people?  It is the value of a complete laptop with a good display, battery, design, and performance.  Windows has so many choices and it can be hard to pinpoint which one to get, so that makes this the laptop of choice for most provided you are okay with MacOS.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022"

USB 4 is Thunderbolt.. if you like Apple and need  new laptop for 1200 bucks you should get this one..","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022"

    I love a good deal!!!","I have been looking for a new laptop, always been a mac fan but lets all be honest. They cost both arms and both legs. But i happen to stumble on this one. The box had a small rip in the side of it and I was able to save a $100!!As far the laptop it's self, well it's a MAC. Need I say more? Best of the best no matter what you use it for. I happen to use it for video editing and web content development. I will say I love how this it is and how lite it is. 5 star any day!!!The finger print scanner makes logging on a breeze and when jumping from site to site that seems everything takes a password to get into.

    It looks great and is as quick but the 14" MacBook Pro is the better buy","The good: very speedy, silent, the midnight color is beautiful (more like a dark gray).The bad or not great:The display is just odd, I can't stand the ugly notch, it's a distraction and doesn't even offer Face ID! Windows laptops have had that for many years now, without a big ugly cut out that feels like it is spying on you with no manual privacy lid (like ThinkPads have for example). Also it is too glossy and reflective, would much prefer a matte anti-glare screen option. The display resolution quality is great, but not as great as the 14" MacBook Pro.The keyboard is OK but shallower than the 14" MacBook Pro. It feels like I am bottoming out when typing with my natural amount of pressure.The speakers/sound are also just OK. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro's speakers which have a better system like up/front speakers, this one sounds like they are only coming from the bottom of the laptop.The weight is a little heavier than I thought. Honestly it is a negligible difference between the MacBook Pro and Air.I will wait for the 14" MacBook Pro with the M2 chip and Midnight color.","Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2022"

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I  retired recently but still need a laptop and this does just about everything. I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better!

 Love this computer","I bought the Apple 2022 MacBook Air with the M2 chip two weeks ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at the price. I primarily use it for web browsing and software development, and I don't have many programs on it. Setting it up was seamless, especially since I have other Apple products. I encountered no issues during the setup.

The Midnight color looks fantastic and is the best quality Air I've ever used. The display and sound are great. While I haven't tried video processing, the M2 chip performs wonderfully. It's noticeably faster than my Mac mini with the M1 chip. I love the size and weight; it's perfect for bringing to the coffee shop. It also seems more durable than my girlfriend's 2020 Air.

The battery lasts at least 8 hours on a single charge, and I can use it at work for a significant portion of the day without needing to recharge. The new charging port style secures via a magnet, which works fine, though it could be a bit stronger.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the price, especially since I've never had a Mac under $1,000. I'm very happy with this purchase and give it 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024"

 Best value","I would like to point out how the new MacBook airs have no cooling fans. I was initially worried the MacBook would over heat. However, I have the sims 3 with several packs and it runs flawlessly and barely gets hot. The MacBook is pretty quick to load and the battery life is amazing! The midnight color is beautiful, but just know that it is a finger print magnet. The sound quality is pretty good, I wish they would have kept the speaker grills next to the keyboard though.","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2024"

 Frustrating, Challenging, and rewarding","Coming from a business environment I became proficient in navigating Windows system. We did use iPhones rather than android and I loved my iPhone. After retirement I purchased an Apple Watch on Prime Day and absolutely love it. I was somewhat bored I read a column indicating the Prime Days Apple promotion were legitimate. I was totally happy with watch purchase and thought this would be fun. Used my prime visa points and purchased. Glad I did. It’s different, challenging, and great little laptop. Great for amateur photography editing to create great photos by adding a frame for some family photos as stocking stuffers. Off topic but the Canon series 200 and Canon paper in a frame makes a great amateur photo. Available on Amazon. If Still learning a lot about Mac but depending on needs other than corporate use I like the little laptop better every day. I purchased the MS office suite for Mac because I wanted Excel, Word, and Outlook? Simple to install and have encountered no problems. Btw you cannot use your points if Apple Care + is included. It’s available from Apple and they will remind you. That little tip would have prevented wasting time with 3 customer service reps that had no idea. Just buy the laptop use your rewards, if you wish then get the care package within the time allocated and no problem.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024"

 A great choice for optimizing price versus performance","This is the perfect macbook air. No need to get an M3 processor when the M2 is fully capable of virtually all tasks, including scientific calculations. By choosing the M2 versus the new M3 version you save hundreds of dollars with virtually no loss in performance. The screen is clear and realistic, and you can watch a movie on it without compromise. My only observation is that the 256 GB SSD that I selected is not quite big enough and requires backing up pictures and music to keep enough space available. I recommend paying more to get 512GB. The 8GB RAM is more than adequate unless you need to manipulate video files.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

    One notch from perfection","This is what I describe as a "chill laptop". It's the reliable, ageless device you park next to your couch and cruise the inter webs on, the computer that transitions to a DJ machine for a party, the one you grab when you need to do some serious professional work. It does it all, it's snappy and the battery life makes you wonder why you ever had to charge a laptop before. Did I mention there isn't any fan noise? It's fantastic.All of the basics are covered on top of that, speakers are great, keyboard is great, screen is great. This is how Apple makes great devices, by nailing the basics. Mac OS feels limited, but ultimately is a just an adjustment period if you're coming from windows. Most apps and programs work, but make sure before you buy this laptop, as MacOS tends to have some extra hoops to jump through. You can game but it entirely depends what game you're playing and if it's compatible. This is the biggest thing, you need to be slightly tech savvy to get Windows and apps running. Apple wants you to use their apps, which are greatly optimized.The only real negative is the notch, if it bothers you and the soldered components that are non-upgradeable. I'm not going to get into debates on how much RAM you need but I've never needed more than 8gb for years now and never experience slow down. I also only live in 3 - 5 browser tabs and close down programs I'm not using. If you're cruising the web and using basic apps this computer will easily last you 4 - 5 years and be better than anything on the market. Not to mention the awesome resale value of Macs.","Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024"

    Disappointing, not as intuitive or useful as earlier MacBook Air","I had/have a 2014 MacBook Air, which was great until touchpad stopped working & battery was on last legs.  Took it to Apple, but they don't have replacement touchpads any more.  Thought a new MacBook Air M@ (2022) seemed like a good replacement at a very reasonable price, but doesn't seem as fast & I had to figure out a lot of new ways to do things that were simple on my 2014 computer.  Overall, sort of felt like a downgrade instead of an upgrade.","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024"

    Far better than I had hoped!","I had never considered a Mac before, I was a lifelong windows user.I’m setting up for part time freelancing. I have years of experience with 3D mechanical engineering and design, as well as high-end 3D photo-realistic rendering and animation.These two disciplines combined require heavy memory usage, CPU power, and GPU speed.For a windows machine, those demands were going to cost me twice what this machine costs. So I researched the technology and talked to a MacBook Pro M1 user. He couldn’t tell me the MacBook Air M2 would meet my demands, but knew the Pro would.I took the chance, and couldn’t be more pleased! Not only have I not slowed it down yet, but this fabless machine base even gotten warm once!Super fast feather light workhorse!I’m still getting used to the OS but that’s been easier than I thought as well.I can honestly say I will never buy another “PC”","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022"

    Good laptop, but pretty underwhelming for the price.","Pros: lightweight, compact, portable. Lighting and resolution. Fingerprint passcode key. Settings have lots of options. Easy to connect to itunes and sync with phone. Good with wifi, fast, good for uninterrupted streaming. Notifications are real time, no perceptible delay.Cons: Trackpad could be more responsive. Trackpad gestures unnecessarily complicated. No touch screen available. Lose bottom of the screen if you select larger texts settings, there is nothing you can do about this, normal is the only uninterrupted setting. Very little control over what appears on your primary toolbar. Extreme lack of options available in Mac app store.","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024"

I did a lot of research and the best price I found was on Amazon and they also offer apple care.  I wouldn't purchase this computer without apple care.

    I was told “if ya love your IPhone and IPad, you need the MacBook”.","Beautiful, thin, light, state of the art M2 chip midnight MacBook is one of my best purchases ever.  My son wanted one for college and I told him I could get him an Intel based laptop with the same power for much less money.  He got a MacBook and he was right.  Forward thinking.  I was afraid of the jump from intel to something I wasn’t familiar with.  15 minute set up and it took all of my contacts, news, emails, bookmarks and pictures from my IPhone 10 X Max over WiFi.  Added an 8-1 hub, a mouse and Microsoft Office Home and Business 2021 lifetime license ($35) for less than $100.  Love this thing and won’t look back.  Not a techie nor early adopter.

I'm not an Apple Fanboy, but have to give Apple side props for making a computer that was functional for 10 years.Getting behind the new M2 Air has been so satisfying. Incredibly snappy, and I've been working on the same charge for several days! Also, I love the new Midnight color.My wife has the previous M1 Air, which is similarly snappy. Honestly, the only reason I held out (and paid a few hundred more) was for the Magsafe charging. (We have a puppy and a baby, and one of the two will be tugging on cords).Overall, very happy with the purchase.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Nice laptop","I bought this laptop this past November and am very happy with it. I upgraded from the M1 Airbook and have no regrets. The MagSafe connector for charging is much better than having to use a USB-C cable. It's a fast computer and battery life is pretty good.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025"

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy. Helps me distinguish mine from others with same laptop in the classic color.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    This laptop is AMAZING! (Silver MacBook Air M3 16GB RAM, 256 GB Storage)","What a laptop! I love this machine. The 16 GB ram is superb for users who are just browsing the web, using this machine for work, watching videos, etc. If you are dependent for heavier workloads consider either the 24 GB RAM model or a base MacBook Pro. Right now the RAM is being used around 8-10 GB out of 16 GB. So thankful apple upgraded their RAM to 16 GB for free. This laptop won't let you down.","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2025"

    LOVE My MacBook","This is my first MacBook and I LOVE it. I've never had a MacBook before and when I first started using it I was very frustrated. It definitely takes some getting used to, but now I love it. Automatically syncs from my iPhone and I love the finger print feature that signs me into any account. I'm really glad I went with the 13 inch option because it's big enough without being bulky.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

    I'm not techy but...","I adore this computer. I was on the fence about upgrading from my still functioning buy terrible battery life, comparable 2018 version. I'm SO glad I did. I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy. Helps me distinguish mine from others with same laptop in the classic color.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Its Mac... If You're Mac User, You'll Love It!","Macs are great machines, do mot have many issues in general. Typically virus free, however Malware or Grayware issues are a possibility, albeit not a frequent possibility. Apple products are built well and designed to last the intended lifespan of the machine (which is generally 6-7 years currently before the EOL update cycle is reached). M3 processors are great and with the most recent tech innovations such as AI this machine will be relevant/adequate throughout the growth process of the technology.","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024"

 Migration from Windows to M1-3 erases file system origin and update chronology","Apple's Migration software from Windows NTFS to MacBook M-3 Apple APFS erases file system origin and update dates. Instead the software treats all files (in my case, thousands) as if they were created on the date of migration. That makes the file system, lacking all chronology, so essentially useless. Apple Care advisor suggested putting the date into the file names. LOL","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024"

 Outstanding!","I purchased an Pavillion 16” laptop directly from HP. It took 2 week to arrive. I HATED it & returned it 5 days later.

I bought this MacBook on Amazon. I received it in two days. It was MUCH easier to set-up. Had a MUCH more intuitive operating system and was faster than the Windows 11 equipped unit.

The MacBook has a great keyboard. Very accurate and responsive touch pad. This computer is sleek, slender and light. The speakers are clear and the volumn can be set loud enough for enjoying movies and music. The screen is very clean, clear and the colors are vibrant.

I do not like the MagSafe charger connection. Happily, I can use a USB-C cable instead. I also wish this laptop had more ports. I also ordered a hub (not expensive) that gives me more ports than I will ever need.

I have been a Mac guy for 30 years. I have had and used several Windows computers over that time. For me, Mac continues to be far superior to any Windows computer I have ever used in business or at home.

This MacBook cost about 40% more than the Pavillion. It was money well-spent. I would have been willing to spend 100% more to not have to suffer through using that HP. Buy a Mac. Buy it from Amazon.

 First Macbook","Windows user here. Got tired of 1 to 2 hours of battery life on windows. Jumping into macOS with both feet. After 8 hours of setup and messing around, I have used 53 percent of my battery. Display is nice. Base 8gb and 256gb drive will meet my needs with a little cloud storage in my future. So far quite impressed. Computer is fast and I suspect it still will be once I know what I am doing in macOS. Bit of a learning curve ahead, but for average user like me ( some office apps and the rest consumption oriented) I think this is going to be perfect. Got Starlight because it was discounted. Nice color, gender neutral. Very happy with this purchase so far. Best personal computer I have ever owned. Makes my previous windows laptops look sad.

Other than that it is a Mac and does what a Mac was built to do. I got it brand new with no defects.So the difference between this M3 15" MacBook Air and the M2 13" MacBook Air are as follows:* It is noticeably heavier, you will feel it even in you backpack. It is best to stick to the 13" for mobility.* The speakers are far clearer & better, better bass that it is mind blowing.* The screen appears to be noticeably clearer & crisper.* The screen real estate though slightly bigger it does count for something. I can see a lot more on this screen.* It feels faster than the M2 air","Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2024"

Currently, I am a Neuroscience major and just switched over from a 6 year old Intel MacBook (which was and is still amazing, but old). If you're thinking about buying this product, from a college student's perspective, it is amazing as it can handle many large programs that professors often require you to work on. Not to mention the Starlight color is beautiful.A piece of advice: Order the MacBook from here instead of Apple directly, because it's cheaper and will have faster delivery.

    INSANELY SLOW","I recently spilt coffee on my beloved 2019 Macbook Pro and decided to replace it with this new model Macbook Air.  The specs looked very similar to my old Pro, so I expected there to not be much difference in performance.  Boy was I WRONG.  This model is so freaking SLOW, it's unbearable.  Closing or opening new internet tabs, switching between internet browser and another window, etc all cause this thing to freeze up and show the little rainbow wheel of stupidity.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I went back on Amazon and bought a used 2019 Pro just like the one I had before.  Guess what - no issues.  Definitely skip this model and either splurge for the new Pro or just get an older model Pro.","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2024"

    Blow my mind! What a great laptop!","I have been an apple user for many years now but for only small electronics like iPhone, airpods, iPad, etc. I have never tried any mac or apple computer. So, let's breakdown my review for this macbook air.Packaging:  As every apple users know, I like the simplicity and how well packaged their devices. When it delivered to me, it comes with amazon box, and there's another brown box where the this macbook box was securely packaged.Color: I like the color that I chose which is sandstone. It looks very classy.Functionality: I have used microsoft surface and other common laptops like HP and this macbook amazed me in many ways. Everyday I learned something new. Also what I like the most is how fast it is! I am using this macbook for my online studying so I have used this for watching videos from different websites and software and it works pretty amazing! I love how Apple has a "Tips" where you can learn all other features and functionality. So as a first timer, it is very useful for me.Sound quality: The sound is pretty loud and clear. You can even watch a movie here.Battery life: As described, the battery life is 18 hours if I am not mistaken. But for me it lasts 24 hours. I think it would depends on how and what you use it for.Screen size: I am glad that I bought the 15" one because it's pretty cool wide screen, it really feels its a laptop computer. I bet if I choose the 13", there would be no much of a difference with my iPad. I like how big the screen, it feel more comfortable reading my course materials and do my writing assessments.Value for money: I think it is worth to buy given the functionality and features that you can benefit from this. I was lucky I bought this during prime big day deals, so it save me like $300.Overall, I love it and I am enjoying using it!","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2024"

 Apple is the best. And these are no exception!","Got my boys these for back to school as we were burning through Chrome Books and I was tired of them constantly breaking. Any cool feature on an HP or otherwise would stop working in 6 months. By the time we were about to order our THIRD Chromebook in as many years, I realized I just needed to invest in something that would last. Got these MacBook Airs for a great price. My boys LOVE the larger 15" screens. I mean - I don't want to work on a tiny screen either! They love them so much and are so careful with them as they value all their Apple products. Hopefully these will last us more than a few years. I know my MacBook is on year 4 and still works like brand new!","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2024"

    MacBook Air one month old fingerprint pw fails.","I liked the MacBook Air until it failed to respond to the fingerprint/power button. The PW is correct as the symbols aren't clear (fuzzy) if thePW is wrong (tried this). Chat support was excellent - downloaded the Mac software and no change. Apple is sending a shipping box with labels to return for repair. This unit is new as the moment it came out of the box - the fingerprint reader is not working. Is this common?Got this back from AppleCare Service with a note the testing could not duplicate the problem... lie to me - tell me you found a problem and fixed it. I like the MacBook Air notebook ... the thumbprint is working and now has pw "or" fingerprint - before it wouldn't open with either - will keep the device - two iPads have been working well for several years - which is why I went with the Apple.Now this review isn't showing up on the Amazon review page?And now the fingerprint reader isn't working again... this is a POS.","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024"

    HATE THIS LAPTOP","First of all, it’s way too heavy. I am used to the Air books of the past that were lighting up to throw in your purse. This thing is a nightmare. It has so many internal glitches that not even Apple tech-support can figure it out. I have checked with at least one professional Apple geek, and he basically says that the new computers. They certainly didn’t give me much of a chance do use it. It is been virtually locking me out since the minute I try to use it. There’s not even anything on the hard drive. I am going to have it cleaned professionally and donate it to charity. That is how bad it is and I will never ever ever buy another Apple computer. I have owned probably 20 for me and for my business is over the years so that says a lot.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024"

 My first MacOS device.","My computer experience goes way back. I have had computers from Atari, Commodore, Amiga and PC dating back to the pre-Windows DOS configuration. This is my first Apple computer and my first laptop.

I have had my Macbook for a month now, and while there has been a bit of a learning curve, it isn't that different in basic operation.

For what I use the Macbook for, is deadly quiet (no fans), it doesn't get hot, even in my lap, and is very light to carry.

As a PC user, I was concerned about the RAM limitations, but I mainly I bought this laptop for basic use (Internet access, email, virtual meetings, occasional streaming on the road) For that kind of usage it works great. I still have my desktop PC, and will continue using it for my heavy lifting, although I am interested to try the Macbook for use in my photography hobby.

While I could have gotten a monster PC laptop for the same money, I have been curious about the Apple computers for a while, as I am nervous about the direction Microsoft is taking Windows of late.

So, this may not be my last Apple computer. Time will tell.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024"

The screen is clear, the keyboard is very responsive, and the track pad/mouse pad is larger so you can move things across the screen a little easier. The one thing I didn't catch before purchasing this is that they solder the memory onto the board, so you are unable to upgrade the onboard memory. I'm a techie so that is a big no-no in my book which is why it gets a 4 star. If I could upgrade the memory myself, I would give it a 5 star.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024"

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy.

I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

    Excellent product","I have used PCs and laptops at home and at work for more years than I care to admit, but my kids and grandkids kept insisting that I needed a MacBook instead. I was hesitant at first, because I was so comfortable with PCs and laptops. Well, my family was right — I should have made the switch to a Mac years ago. One of my sons walked me through some of the features before leaving me on my own, which helped. After using it for the past few weeks, I’m convinced this was the right move. I have zero regrets and will never voluntarily go back to a PC or laptop.","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024"

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

I've bought a $400 Dell laptop for myself as just a test machine and it has all the ports you'd expect on a laptop. I had to buy my wife a usb-c dong which is ridiculous. At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple. My son's new laptop I have upgraded and it's great.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

 Excellent performance and battery life","A great first Mac for a life-long Windows user. I love the slick Mac OS, quality hardware, excellent performance, and long battery life. Easy setup and transfer of content from my previous computer. Tight integration with iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods enhances the experience. The ultra-thin and lightweight form-factor will be great for travel as well.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025"

 Incredible Machine","Beautiful hardware inside and out. Lightweight and portable but still incredibly smooth and fast. The latest MacOs runs flawlessly on this MacBook.

It has no issues keeping up with me and jumping between VS code, logic, safari, email, etc. handles anything you throw at it.

I haven’t tried any video editing, but I did play a bit of Civilization 6 and it runs great.

Battery life is phenomenal as with all the apple silicon.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024"

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025"

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025"

 So thin and lightweight, looks amazing, sounds good, it's my new favorite computer.","I bought this after I got laid off with some of my severance pay because I hadn't had a new computer in over a decade. Good lord it's fast! I use it to design 3D printed products I sell, watch YouTube, web etc. the battery lasts longer than all day which is ridiculously amazing. it's so thin and light I had trouble finding a case that didn't seem bulky. I ended up using a case for a 14" laptop that fits snug on it. I love love love that my monitors actually power and charge it, so I can leave its tiny AC adapter in the bag so I can just grab it and GO when I need to. I've taken it on trips and it's so easy to lug around, easy to use on a plane in my lap or the tray table too. Be sure to get yourself a usb-c adapter dongle - I got one that snaps to the side that adds ports and such - only if you need older ports of course. I use it with 3 monitors via a 'DisplayLink' hub, that's the only drawback against this vs the PRO, by the way. You can only run 2 monitors natively, but the display link hub adds a 3rd (and more) and is even portable","Reviewed in the United States on December 23, 2024"

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it. I bought this in September 2024 but just starting using it as time finally allows me to write.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024"

Found this macbook air 15 inch M3 with 16 gb memory and 256 gb hard drive for hundreds lower than apple retail website price so it’s a fantastic value. Shipping only took 2 weeks even though I was expecting 6 weeks when I initially ordered it, so it’s early arrival was a nice surprise.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024"

    Love, love, love this machine!","My previous Macbook was the 13" 2012 Pro 750GB; it lasted 8 1/2 years before breaking down beyond reasonable repair. I was financially challenged to replace with another Apple product, so I went for the more budget friendly pc line. Fast forward to today, I was ready to come back to my true love, and with the Black Friday deals from Amazon ($1419.00), I now have a well-built machine that should be good for another 8+ years. I'm a middle school math teacher, so this product's specs are in the "just right" catagory. Love the ease of use and streamlined user interface. Love the sound this produces. Love the 15" screen real estate which makes for a better multi-tasking experience. And overall, love how this Macbook Air fits into my life!After receiving my new Macbook, I ended up investing in the Apple Care+ yearly subscription for peace of mind.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024"

    Very nice computer","Let me start by saying I am not Apple's biggest fan - I've always used Dell or HP machines so this one has been a bit of a learning curve for me.  With that being said, I am really impressed with this laptop.  My daughter and I are the media team at our church where we are responsible for creating announcement videos and presentation slides.  The graphics are super clear and the processing speed is amazing.  There is no waiting for software to open and having multiple programs open doesn't slow it down.  We purchased a monitor and dock with this machine and it has turned out to be a great system.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024"

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024"

    Awesome","The glass on my prior MacBook Pro broke.  Not worth replacing since the laptop was more than five years old.  When I went to purchase a new MacBook Pro, I learned that Apple eliminated the 15" screen on the new MacBook Pros (I think this was dumb).  The 13.4" is too small and the 17" is way too big and heavy.  The salesperson at a retail store  suggested I look at the MacBook Air (Caveat: I do not do any heavy graphics, animation, editing or video/photo work), so the M3 Chip, 16GB, 512GB is more than adequate.  I was able to purchase this 15.3" Laptop with 3 years of Apple Care at $300.00 less than the retail store. This is a terrific laptop for everything.  I don't do any video or editing, so your needs may be different.  But I constantly run Acrobat Pro, Excel, Word, and other programs simultaneously and it is fast.  The screen is terrific, it has built-in retina display and the images are super crisp.  I watch movies on this laptop and I have no issues with the display.  If you are needing a new MacBook and the price of the new MacBook Pros made your eyes water, I highly recommend the MacBook Air.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024"

At the minimum it should have hdmi, ethernet, and a few usb-a ports. The other issue is that you can't upgrade the ram or internal ssd and those upgrades cost an arm and a leg from Apple.

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.)

    the best deal to get macOS AND Windows in your bag.","M3 / 16gb macbook air with full 1 yr apple warranty for hundreds less. Came factory sealed in original packaging. With my usage - about 2 hours a day - i charge it less than once a week.Installed VMware Fusion (free) and Windows 11 for ARM and now have both environments in a very long lasting and super portable package. Even with windows running and giving 8gb to both OS'es, I do not feel any sluggishness on either side.

No ha sido una transición fácil, los comandos y las costumbres marcan, sin embargo los beneficios han sido muy notorios:Inicio inmediato del sistema, ningún lag pese a que uso múltiples exploradores y programas al tiempo, imagen impecable, muy buena duración de batería, excelente integración con tu iPhone, conectividad perfecta.Sobre el color, es muy elegante y me ha gustado mucho, con los case combina muy bien y no molesta para las huellas sobre el material.Por mejorar podría ser el material de las teclas que asume un desgaste de huella prematuro y se va viendo brillante, aunque veo que es fácil y económico comprarlas y cambiarlas con los años.","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver.

I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all.

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024"

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well. This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025"

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024"

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- "Just works" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in "Midnight" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.","Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024"

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024"

    Awesome deal! Battery life is great!","Bought this one during Black Friday deals and it works great. Had to replace my old Macbook as the screen and battery was becoming faulty. In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024"

    I'm not techy but...","I adore this computer. I was on the fence about upgrading from my still functioning buy terrible battery life, comparable 2018 version. I'm SO glad I did. I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy. Helps me distinguish mine from others with same laptop in the classic color.","Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024"

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024"

    Best laptop purchase I've made in a long while","My last Apple laptop was a 2017 MBP 13". This MBA 13" M3 is a transcendent improvement over that device. The fanless design ensures quiet operation, and I have yet to notice any thermal slow down in my day to day use of the device.I find the updated 13" screen to be a vast improvement, even with the dreaded 'notch'. Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs. However, the laptop is still a joy to type on.Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, and Amazon had great service and fast delivery as always.","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024"

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    All around excellent","I was torn between the M2 and M3 MacBooks but decided I wanted to save the $100 and get the M2, since I’m not doing anything too crazy. This really has been such an excellent laptop. My first new Mac in 14 years,the battery lasts a very long time, screen and sound quality are great, comfortable to use. I did have to get an adapter for other ports since it only has USB C but I honestly use it very rarely. Hoping it lasts as long as my previous Mac!","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024"

    Fast and very capable computer","I bought this MacBook Air to replace my old 2011 model. I considered buying an M3 model, but this one costs a lot less. Also, having experienced with 4GB Ram and 128 GB storage, I decided to go with the 16 GB Ram and 512 GB storage. I was not disappointed! This Mac is fast! The 2011 model served me well for 13 years, and I sure believe this one will do as well.","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I  retired recently but still need a laptop and this does just about everything. I can even charge it on the same C cable I use for everything else although it does have a magnetic charging cable as well. I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack. It’s heavier than previous models but it’s put together better too, not to mention I got the upgraded memory as well. Great Apple product as usual.","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better! Now I don't have a computer for a week.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025"

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 The Perfect Balance of Power and Portability","The MacBook Air M2 with 16GB RAM is an outstanding laptop. It handles multitasking and demanding tasks like video editing effortlessly. The battery life is exceptional, easily lasting a full day, and the lightweight design makes it perfect for on-the-go use.

The Liquid Retina display is stunning, and the keyboard and trackpad are top-notch. While the limited ports require an adapter for peripherals, the overall performance, sleek design, and future-proofing make this a fantastic investment. Highly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024"

 Amazing laptop for school and in general","This laptop is so good for school and even for general everyday tasks. Also the value for money is amazing. The quality of the sound and speed is also amazing. The size is super thin and nice for students to carry.

 Great deal on a great laptop","My mother’s 8 year old MacBook has begun to get sluggish, so I’ve been looking for a replacement. This one was just what she needed. She’s 79, so she doesn’t need all the bells and whistles. This MacBook Air is perfect for her.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

I bought a 100 watt charging block with ports for everything and with that and whatever other electronics I need I still have a light backpack.

This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025"

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025"

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025"

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023"

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022"

    First Mac and Last","I’ve always used windows computers so this is way different. Have used an iPad, so there’s some familiarity. Love the lighted keyboard and it’s lightweight overall. Battery lasts a long time.  It’s not a touch screen which I thought it was. Wish you could change the name of SIRI to something else especially when you change the voice. Maybe you can? And, i’ve just not discovered it yet.  Miss internal optical readers, sigh. Oh well.Update 01/21/2025 - I hate this computer.  So absolutely sorry I bought it.  I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.  The mouse pad also has a mind of its own and requires really hard contact to get the cursor to move.  Then all of a sudden I cant get the cursor to move at all.  Half the time I cannot get the up/down arrows to scroll in a screen. Blaaaaaahhhhh.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025"

    Fantastic","My children are using these for their school and sometimes use them to play online games. They had never used a Mac before, but had used iPads, and had a small learning curve for these and were quickly comfortable using them on a daily basis. I know these are quality products that will last them a long time, which is why I wanted to put the money in now, so that we didn't have to buy a new laptop every 2 years. Very happy with our purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2023"

    New Macbook Air lasted only 7 weeks!","At first I was very happy with my Macbook Air. However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!) This laptop had never left my bedroom and is used basically for sending and receiving emails. Surely, Apple and Amazon should be expected to do better! Now I don't have a computer for a week.","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025"

    Excellent product, tho does not play nice with Google Drive","It is fast, light, awesome screen....the full package. My only complaint is it is sluggish if I am working on documents on Google Drive that are synced locally and google drive is on. Opening a pdf takes 3-8 seconds, working on one is frustrating because of what feels like a huge latency.This is not the case on my 2018 MacBook pro so there is something going on in the background.Working on non-Google Drive docs is a breeze.","Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023"

    Defectuosa despues de un mes de uso","En menos de un mes de uso noté una franja vertical que cambiaba la tonalidad real del color de la pantalla, el servicio al cliente de amazon me redirigio al servicio al cliente de Apple el cual confirmó que se trataba de un defecto de fabrica, apple decidió cambiar la pantalla y convirtió una computadora completamente nueva en una rescontruida sin darme ninguna otra opción.","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024"
