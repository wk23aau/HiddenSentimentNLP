 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars perfect family computer,"I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.,,,but much faster),it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Fast and flawless,"I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars 2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station,"Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components. Also the price of upgrades in Memory and Drive size are ridiculous.",2024-11-26

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Fast and flawless,"I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars 2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station,"Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product.

    It Be Tiny, But It be Powerful!","As soon as I saw this Mac mini and read about it, I knew I had to have one. The size and power of the device is just incredible. While I have a few different kinds of Macs, this is an excellent one for those thinking about making the switch from Windows. I’ve read some reviews, and the biggest complaint people have is where the power button is. That’s just silly to me.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.

After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front.

It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT.

This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars perfect family computer,"I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.,,,but much faster),it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components. Also the price of upgrades in Memory and Drive size are ridiculous.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.,"My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac.

The Mac Mini has no built in microphone. I have researched using my iPhone 12 Max Pro as a video camera and microphone but with little success. I have looked at purchasing an external microphone that will make spoken Siri work but what I am finding from others that have done the same they are not successful.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem. We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t. We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone. Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.",2024-12-07

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

Very happy with my purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Astonished,"Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks.

 So much better than Windows!","I am a Realtor and our office only had window computers. I have an iphone, Macbook and an ipad all that sync together so I can pick up where I left off when I'm working. I finally couldn't stand it anymore and purchase my own iMac for my office. I save so much time being able to airdrop from other agents, text agents and clients while I am working instead of having to stop what I am doing and pick up my phone to respond to a text. So many other benefits but I am envied by everyone else in the office that is still having to deal with their windows computer. Not to mention the speed and graphics on this are amazing!","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars So much better than Windows!,"I am a Realtor and our office only had window computers.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks. Very happy with the purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars What an upgrade!,"After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system.

I had to click three or four times whenever I wanted to open something. The keyboard wouldn't work right most of the time. I would try to respond to an email and it wouldn't space or would freeze. If I shut off the whole system and rebooted it would work for awhile then freeze again. I have a 2 year old Apple mini and it is just fine.
