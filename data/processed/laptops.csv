 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars perfect family computer,"I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.,,,but much faster),it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

 This Tiny Monster is a Beast! (Mac Mini M4 with 24GB RAM)","I'm absolutely loving the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip! I went for the 24GB RAM configuration, and this little machine is a productivity powerhouse.

My work revolves around heavy browser use - countless tabs, web applications, and online tools running simultaneously. The Mac Mini handles it all flawlessly. The M4 chip is incredibly fast and efficient. I've never experienced such smooth performance, even with dozens of tabs open and multiple web apps running.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Fast and flawless,"I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars 2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station,"Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components.

I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components. Also the price of upgrades in Memory and Drive size are ridiculous.",2024-11-26

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    Fast and flawless","I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.  It's really fast, and works great.  I don't really know if the regular M4 would be enough for me, but after seeing some comparisons on YouTube I decided the extra cost was probably worth it.  I typically run multiple browsers, Mail, Messages, Excel, Word, Spotify, and ThinkOrSwim (stock trading software) and other apps simultaneously, with two 4K monitors.  When I click something in ThinkOrSwim, I want it to execute NOW, so the M4 Pro's speed is reassuring.  Nothing I do seems to bother this Mac.  The (fully-loaded) Intel Mini was fine for 6 years, I expect at least the same out of the M4 Pro Mini.","Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Fast and flawless,"I replaced my 32MB 2018 Intel Mini with the M4 Pro Mini with 24GB.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front. It was easily worth the price difference between the 256GB model and the 512GB model, allowing me a near-pocketable portable development setup (sans monitor).","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars 2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station,"Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product.

    It Be Tiny, But It be Powerful!","As soon as I saw this Mac mini and read about it, I knew I had to have one. The size and power of the device is just incredible. While I have a few different kinds of Macs, this is an excellent one for those thinking about making the switch from Windows. I’ve read some reviews, and the biggest complaint people have is where the power button is. That’s just silly to me.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,

EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.

After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front.

It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT.

This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic.

 perfect family computer","I can't say enough good things about this little computer. I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)

Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.

All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars perfect family computer,"I can't say enough good things about this little computer.

It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.,,,,,,,
I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.,,,,,,,,
EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her. We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS. The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux. The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.,,,,,,,
As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage. It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer. I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.,,,but much faster),it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.

    Great little computer","I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.  I started by moving my old mac to a different room with a different monitor, keyboard, mouse, ethernet.  I then got this one plugged in and got a wired keyboard and mouse ready for first boot.  My normal keyboard and mouse are bluetooth, not Apple, and I wasn't expecting them to work on first boot.  However, the process of syncing both keyboard and mouse was effortless and I never needed the wired ones.  I had some trouble with the migration assistant, but eventually got that worked out by temporarily disabling the firewall or something.  Things went smoothly after that.  After a reboot, and signing in as my user, I was presented with my familiar desktop, configured identically to my old mac.  To me, this was a good out of box experience.  My only gripe so far has been with a lack of high DPI scaling in the OS.  I use this on a 4K/120Hz/HDR monitor and the only way to scale the interface is to change the resolution.  Changing the resolution to anything in between 1K and 4K for me disables high refresh or color depth.  So, I'm running full resolution so that I get the best picture, but the interface is small.  This scaling is different than what I'm familiar with in Windows or Ubuntu, in which they keep the high resolution but redraw the interface.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little computer,"I got this to replace an M1 Mac Mini and have been very happy.

    2X Size plus 2X speed SSD support: hits the sweet spot for a development station","Of course this Mac Mini was top-notch in terms of packaging--it's an Apple product. It was a nice surprise to see that the 512GB drive hits speeds higher than my 512GB Macbook Air as well. The Thunderbolt 4 ports work great, and it interfaces well with my Sabrent mini TB4 PD hub, achieving 40Gbps easily for my external SSD whether connected directly or through the hub.I have evaluated a few TB4 cables and not been disappointed. There are two reported USB ports on the front. So far, I have seen only 10Gbps at best out of each, but I don't have any true USB4 devices to test higher speeds. The HDMI easily supports my 2K monitor at 144Hz, but my TB4 to DisplayPort 2.1 cable does a better job in both display appearance and refresh rate, hitting my monitor's top rate of 165Hz, some of which is probably due to DisplayPort. It shows no issues with tearing. On top of that, it works connected through my TB4 mini-hub, while still allowing me to hit top speed on my external 4TB  M.2 SSD, which runs at 3,100MB/s read/write while the display is also attached, meaning I still have 3 TB4 ports free (2 direct, 1 additional hub port), plus the 2 USB ports in front.

    This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.","My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac. This Mac Mini M4 Pro probably was overkill for me as I don't really do anything that resource intensive on a PC. I probably should have purchased the M4 with 512GB SSD instead but I wanted to future proof my purchase. So far I can say the transition to a Mac as been very smooth and easy for me but I am in IT. I love how fast this thing is for how small and quiet it is. I have to say I am also liking the Mac OS which I find to be very intuitive. Since I already love my iPad and iPhone this move only made sense and I am loving it. This is a great computer but if you don't need the power just get the Mac Mini M4 base model and maybe the 512GB SSD upgrade, or not, as the 256GB drive is pretty small. You can always run an external SSD and stick with the 256GB drive. The reason for 4 stars is the power button on the bottom is absolutely idiotic. I don't care if most people put their Macs to sleep I shut off all my computers and they last forever so don't tell me it is hard on the components. Also the price of upgrades in Memory and Drive size are ridiculous.","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2024",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars This Mac Mini M4 Pro is my first Mac PC ever.,"My HP Windows 10 PC is getting close to be end of support so I thought now is as good a time as ever to make the switch to a Mac.

The Mac Mini has no built in microphone. I have researched using my iPhone 12 Max Pro as a video camera and microphone but with little success. I have looked at purchasing an external microphone that will make spoken Siri work but what I am finding from others that have done the same they are not successful.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem. We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t. We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone. Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.",2024-12-07

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 Absolutely Astonished","Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were. This IMAC is almost like a piece of Alien technology to me. I generally just use my computer for everyday things and so have not much need of a 10 Core 10 CPU powerhouse.

I wanted something that would let me navigate the coming AI wave and grow with me for a few years. This is truly and amazing piece of hardware. It has taken me a while to get everything set up and connected (Accounts/Passwords), but it is truly beautiful to behold and amazing to operate.

Very happy with my purchase!","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Astonished,"Having recently transferred all the way to Apple products I have been blown away by how intuitive the devices were.

 Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple. Apple service has diminished greatly of late. I went to the local Apple Store with the expectation of walking out of the store with both a new IMac and a new IPhone. This was being purchased for an 75-year old woman to replace her 11-year old IMac, which could no longer be updated (thanks Apple). There was nothing wrong with the original IMac except for this significant problem.

We were at the store 2-days before the release of the the latest IMac, but she wasn’t clutching her pearls waiting for the latest version. So we learn that the store has zero inventory to make room for the latest models. Brilliant shot in the foot Apple. An eager customer shows up at your door to drop $2,000, but they can’t.

We were able to walk out with an IPhone 14 (not the latest model). About 3-weeks into use of the phone, there was a problem connecting to her WiFi network, so she called Apple for assistance. Four hours later, she was unable to use either her old phone or her new one and Apple told her she needed to contact the phone service carrier. Again, thank you Apple. A 15-minute call with the carrier resolved everything even though they were completely uninvolved with the initial setup and transfer to the new phone.

Apple products are high quality and recommended, but avoid Apple if at all possible.","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Apple products are GREAT, Apple service is terrible.","I like Apple products as long as I don’t have to deal with Apple.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks.

 So much better than Windows!","I am a Realtor and our office only had window computers. I have an iphone, Macbook and an ipad all that sync together so I can pick up where I left off when I'm working. I finally couldn't stand it anymore and purchase my own iMac for my office. I save so much time being able to airdrop from other agents, text agents and clients while I am working instead of having to stop what I am doing and pick up my phone to respond to a text.

 What an upgrade!","After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system. However, it was easy to set up and going through the online user manual was helpful too. I bought the AppleCare too, and the tech was able to walk me through a few things I didn’t understand which differed from Windows. Also my email didn’t transfer over from the cloud even though all my photos and passwords did. But I shared my screen with the tech and he helped me resolve that problem. I’m still getting used to the new operating system but I love how fast it is and how crisp every looks. Very happy with the purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars What an upgrade!,"After using a Dell for the last ten years and a Gateway before that, I was a little hesitant to switch to iMac because there is definitely a learning curve using a new operating system.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you. I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer. Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version. What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB. Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change. Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives. This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel. The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used. The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button. The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors. The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad. I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom. The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel. I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color. This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it. So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop. -if you want an M Series computer - get it. -if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it. -if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer -if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it -if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it -if you want all-day battery life- get it -if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it -if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.",2025-02-17

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

    Fantastic","My children are using these for their school and sometimes use them to play online games. They had never used a Mac before, but had used iPads, and had a small learning curve for these and were quickly comfortable using them on a daily basis. I know these are quality products that will last them a long time, which is why I wanted to put the money in now, so that we didn't have to buy a new laptop every 2 years.

However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair. This would be an over $550 repair except I am clearly in the warranty period (received in December and repair needed in January!)

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging.

• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.",2025-01-10

This really has been such an excellent laptop. My first new Mac in 14 years,the battery lasts a very long time, screen and sound quality are great, comfortable to use. I did have to get an adapter for other ports since it only has USB C but I honestly use it very rarely.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity. So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully! The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice laptop and solid as a rock,"First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever .

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing laptop,"Love how slim and light weight this is.

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this. It is worth every dollar.","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned,"If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    LOVE My MacBook","This is my first MacBook and I LOVE it. I've never had a MacBook before and when I first started using it I was very frustrated. It definitely takes some getting used to, but now I love it. Automatically syncs from my iPhone and I love the finger print feature that signs me into any account. I'm really glad I went with the 13 inch option because it's big enough without being bulky.","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE My MacBook,"This is my first MacBook and I LOVE it.

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago.

The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver.

    Awesome deal! Battery life is great!","Bought this one during Black Friday deals and it works great. Had to replace my old Macbook as the screen and battery was becoming faulty. In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind.

I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone, that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments. All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase. I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise. Thanks",2025-01-19

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Absolutely Amazing and one of the greatest laptops I've ever owned","If any of you have ever used a windows laptop you know how it can be clunky at times, it can feel warm or even over heat, and sometimes the battery life is awful. This laptop does the opposite of all of that.

I've owned this laptop for a month now. I've never once even felt that it was warm even when I was playing games. Everything on this laptop feels smooth and not once has this laptop blue screened, randomly shut down, or any applications crashed.

If you want a smooth fast laptop with absolutely amazing battery life that never gets hot or even warm? This is the laptop and I'm extremely happy I bought this.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

The 16 GB ram is superb for users who are just browsing the web, using this machine for work, watching videos, etc. If you are dependent for heavier workloads consider either the 24 GB RAM model or a base MacBook Pro. Right now the RAM is being used around 8-10 GB out of 16 GB. So thankful apple upgraded their RAM to 16 GB for free.

The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer.

I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This one is taking me a bit to get used to and the screen is already damaged after very little use. (I just pulled it out of the box a couple of days ago.). It’s also heavier than I remembered. It won’t keep me from getting a new one when I get the chance, but it is a little disappointing to have a damaged screen after so little time using it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Screen is Damaged after little useage,"I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop.

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.) Size- I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience. So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it. Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs. Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight. Good luck, everyone!",2024-06-14

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well.

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.

    Excellent product","I have used PCs and laptops at home and at work for more years than I care to admit, but my kids and grandkids kept insisting that I needed a MacBook instead. I was hesitant at first, because I was so comfortable with PCs and laptops. Well, my family was right — I should have made the switch to a Mac years ago. One of my sons walked me through some of the features before leaving me on my own, which helped. After using it for the past few weeks, I’m convinced this was the right move.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!",2024-10-02

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

I was happy that Apple had 15” MacBook Air because I needed the bigger screen but not the extra tech of a Pro. The notebook works great and the transfer of data from one the old to the new was simple. Also it was a great deal as I got it during the Black Friday specials. Love the thinness and size of the computer and the battery life is amazing. Should last me another 8-9 years which is why I moved to Mac anyway. Never had a PC last more than 2-3 years.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Always Good,I have used Apple notebooks for a long time and they never disappoint.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny.

Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password. Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.",2024-11-29

    Replacing a Macbook",Very happy to make this purchase at a discounted price over the holidays.  I bought this to replace an old Macbook Pro I had at a secondary property.

I'll add an external hard drive or find another way to connect it to my extensive music collection.  Now I have a computer to travel with if I want.

    Very nice computer","Let me start by saying I am not Apple's biggest fan - I've always used Dell or HP machines so this one has been a bit of a learning curve for me.  With that being said, I am really impressed with this laptop.  My daughter and I are the media team at our church where we are responsible for creating announcement videos and presentation slides.  The graphics are super clear and the processing speed is amazing.  There is no waiting for software to open and having multiple programs open doesn't slow it down.  We purchased a monitor and dock with this machine and it has turned out to be a great system.","Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Very nice computer,"Let me start by saying I am not Apple's biggest fan - I've always used Dell or HP machines so this one has been a bit of a learning curve for me.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me.

It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me.

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Apple product I've ever owned,"I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours. One star is deducted for a high price as well as a keyboard that is ever so slightly different from windows keyboards and takes some getting used to.","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2024",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Best part is the battery life,"I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013.

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

I won't hesitate to recommend this to my friends if they're looking to change from Windows to Apple.","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible bang for your buck!,"As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

I didn’t think it would be different from my phone. There are some things to adjust to but nothing too difficult. I love the screen size and I especially love the battery life. Game changer in my opinion. I worried a little about shipping but that was smooth and required a signature. Very pleased.,2024-12-30

    Always Good",I have used Apple notebooks for a long time and they never disappoint. This is an upgrade to a 9 year old MacBook Pro that still works great but can no longer be upgraded. I was happy that Apple had 15” MacBook Air because I needed the bigger screen but not the extra tech of a Pro. The notebook works great and the transfer of data from one the old to the new was simple. Also it was a great deal as I got it during the Black Friday specials. Love the thinness and size of the computer and the battery life is amazing. Should last me another 8-9 years which is why I moved to Mac anyway.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

My son's new laptop I have upgraded and it's great.",2025-01-29

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing.

Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

    Easy conversion","My conversion to Mac from being a lifelong Windows user was fantastic.  After putting off the transition for years, I made the leap and very happy with ease of use with the MacBook Air. It's so sweet not having all kinds of Windows patches to apply and rebooting all the time.The MacBook costs more than a Windows machine, but the fact that one can use it without all the fuss and interruptions of rebooting provides more value.  So far after a month I have done zero rebooting and 100 percent computing.","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Easy conversion,"My conversion to Mac from being a lifelong Windows user was fantastic.

I got the black one which shows smudges more than my old space gray one, but no biggie.  Much faster than my old one, and it’s nice to have good battery life again.

 Well built, portable, aesthetically pleasing","I needed a laptop to separate work from personal activities. I thought about getting a Chromebook, but the ones reported to have better build quality were almost as expensive as Windows and Mac laptops. When the MacBook Air M2 went on clearance sale, I jumped on it. I use a MacBook for work, so it is a plus not having to keep two systems in mind. I had seen concerns in reviews about 8 GB memory being insufficient, but I find it very responsive for my light use: email, web browsing, some word processing and watching videos. I don't play video games or do video editing. The screen is nice and big enough for me, and the keyboard has a nice solid feel.

- You enjoy a bright monitor and a pretty decent keyboard to type on.,,,,,,,,
At the same time, I would NOT recommend this model if you need the following:,,,,,,,
- You'll be running large programs that require a lot of local storage.,,,,,,,,
- You require a machine that will process/render high-resolution media. The lack of a fan will cause the Macbook to thermal throttle, lowering your performance. For a little more, you're better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.,,,,you're better off going with the base model Macbook Pro.,,
- Gaming (Thermal throttle will lower framerates).,,,,,,,,

- Despite the lack of larger, more visible speakers, the sound is decent for this category of laptop.,,,,the sound is decent for this category of laptop.,,
- The low power requirements make this an easy travel laptop, not requiring that you bring a huge brick to keep this thing going.,,,,,,,

    Air Review","I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact. My previous Macs have been indestructible so this change must be from the new construction. I was told there's no way to prevent the same damage to the trackpad in the future which makes me relatively concerned about ongoing cost if the same problem continues to occur. I would purchase an older, more durable model before this one, or be sure to get AppleCare+ because they aren't quite made to last as they used to be! Without these issues it would be a great computer, it's fast, light, portable, and holds long battery life, but the constant need to get costly repairs just doesn't offset it!","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2022",1.0,1.0 out of 5 stars Air Review,"I've owned two Mac's (one Pro one Air) prior to this one and only purchased a new Mac because my last one was too old and could no longer support Google Chrome, videos, etc. In two months there have been several hairline cracks develop on my screen and the trackpad has cracked without any impact.

    Buying a base model mac with only 8GB of ram is a terrible mistake","It's practically criminal that Apple gets away with hamstringing it's base models with so little RAM. The first MBA I bought in 2011 had that much memory in it. Anyone who uses more that one browser tab or app at a time is going to be in a world of spinning beachball pain. It's also gross that Apple charges $200 just to upgrade to 16GB. But there is no way around it, you really need 16 (or better 24+GB) or you are going to regret it. Macbook Airs are great machines, that will last you a long time, but not if you buy the base model! The base model pricing is also just a lie.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity. So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents. You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games.

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

    Amazing laptop","Love how slim and light weight this is. If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

If you own an iPhone the integration is perfect. You can manage your messages, calls, & emails on this device. Everything syncs up beautifully! The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

I cant figure out what it is doing half the time.  It does weird stuff on its own.  There are too many steps just to copy or delete a text in a message or email.

    Amazing battery life backed up by an amazing hardware experience","I got the base 256GB 8GB of ram model and this thing does everything I need it to and more. I consider myself fairly tech savvy, so when I heard all the controversy surrounding this model and its slower SSD, I was a little hesitant. After realizing what I wanted to do with the computer, this become a non-factor. I mostly do school (computer science) a little bit of rendering for my 3d printer and some very light gaming. The SSD has never been an issue in my day to day. If you are editing photos or access large files that will need to be read or written to often, maybe go to the 512GB model to get the faster SSD. If you are not working in CAD or video/photo editing all the time you will not care I promise. The rest of this machine has astounded me. 18 hours of battery life is not just marketing, the speed of the M2 is snappy and can handle much more than I thought it would. The new screen is gorgeous. Trackpad is the best on the market bar none. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have ever felt on a laptop and is an absolute joy to type on. MagSafe is back and amazing as before. Probably my favorite thing about this laptop, coming from a Windows gaming laptop is the lack of a fan. You will lose a little performance, but not having that noise is absolutely astounding.

    2022 M2 Shipped for repairs twice in first 6 months. Same problem. Many, many hours lost.","I'm glad to see that many others have had a good experience. Not me. I purchased the new MacBook Air M2 on 12-15-23. Worked fine for about two months. Then, the cursor would freeze for no apparent reason. Had to constantly restart. Of course the Amazon return window closed. Spent hours on the phone with Apple Care techs. Drove 40 miles to an Apple Store. They shipped it in for repairs. It was shipped to my home a few days later with a repair document indicating the Track Pad had been replaced. At this time it would work until you open and close the lid. The cursor would be frozen. Several more sessions with Apple Care techs. They shipped me a box. I boxed it up and shipped it out with a long note indicating the problem. It was returned to me 2 days later with a document indicating they had replaced the lid angle sensor. Still the same problem. Had an hour long session with an Apple Care tech last  weekend that got disconnected and another one today that suggested I try connecting a mouse to see if the problem persists to rule out the Track Pad. Although all of the shipping and repairs have so far been covered by the original Apple warranty, I'm still out for hours and hours spent trying to get it working. Plus out $1,200.00 for the original purchase. Have two other MacBook Airs (2014 & 2015) and never had a problem with either one and they have both traveled literally around the country multiple times.

    First Mac -- Blown Away","I've long been a PC user, built my own pretty decent gaming rig a few years ago. I recently enrolled in school and decided I needed something portable. After reading reviews, I decided that this was the way to go.I've used Windows my entire life and never really gave the idea of MacOS a thought, but I absolutely love it. It has some similarities to Linux, which I've used in the past. It syncs flawlessly to other Apple products (I already had the iPhone and AirPods,) which is really cool. I love using Messenger on my computer, a feature I never knew I needed.As for the hardware, it's solid. The unit itself is very light, but still feels incredibly sturdy. My main complaint is how easily the surface smudges -- a minor issue. I just got a clear clamshell case for mine and it looks good without smudging. I don't use the camera much but I did play around with it for a little bit and it looks great. The keyboard is pretty much silent and the touchpad is nice, took a little getting used to coming from Windows but I figured it out after a few hours of use. The thumbprint touch pad works great and is super convenient. The display is gorgeous, incredibly rich colors and great contrast.Overall, a great purchase. I was a little scared to go all-in and jump into MacOS, but I don' t have any regrets at all. I'd even consider getting an iMac now. Super impressed with the hardware, software and everything else on this machine. Highly recommend, even at MSRP.","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars First Mac -- Blown Away,"I've long been a PC user, built my own pretty decent gaming rig a few years ago.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

    All around excellent","I was torn between the M2 and M3 MacBooks but decided I wanted to save the $100 and get the M2, since I’m not doing anything too crazy. This really has been such an excellent laptop. My first new Mac in 14 years,the battery lasts a very long time, screen and sound quality are great, comfortable to use. I did have to get an adapter for other ports since it only has USB C but I honestly use it very rarely. Hoping it lasts as long as my previous Mac!","Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars All around excellent,"I was torn between the M2 and M3 MacBooks but decided I wanted to save the $100 and get the M2, since I’m not doing anything too crazy.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

 First impression on Starlight.","I had windows before and now I have a Mac. This is a great purchase. The laptop made a big impression on me.
The delivery: I was supposed to sign for it upon delivery and I never did. It was dropped off on my front doorstep. She caught me doing something with my hands full and wet, and I assume she had to be going to her next delivery to stay on schedule. Back to the Mac review.
The M2 Air: What can I tell you? This thing is really small. Upon taking it out of its packaging, I held it in my hands and it felt like I was holding a composition notebook, but a tad bit lighter. It does not feel like holding an envelope like it was revealed back in the first Mac Air laptop. It was like holding a windows surface laptop, except lighter. The laptop turned on on its own and I set up everything in less than half an hour. I may miss right clicking with my old windows laptop, but holding down the scrolling pad is way easier on this thing. I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now.
The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboard
is about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for.
Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that.
Multi-tasking / browsing / usage
Some sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage.
Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves.
And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine.

I learned the basics, the advanced internet tips and tricks, and the essentials in less than ten minutes. I picked up on everything in less than an hour. It took me longer to choose a password than anything else. Lol. But, it was simple. It runs really smooth and I hear nothing. It’s so silent, I tapped on the mute button and it does not give out one sound from the internal system. It’s easily the best laptop out right now. The one con I have: There are none aside from the fact that the typing on the keyboard is about the only noise you’ll pick up. Yes, the keyboard fret buttons sound plastic and rub on them and it sounds like an eerie screeching noise. In all retrospect, I’m not about to rub the keyboard. That’s not what it’s for. Video / Audio: I watched on Apple TV. The sound became better to my ears switching from watching an HD movie to a 4K movie. I watched The Blair Witch Project, the old film from 1999, then I put on the new Blair Witch movie that resolutes a picture of 4K and let me say that the audio on 4K sounds crispier than HD movies. I could hear the footsteps and environmental noises for full immersion. It was like I was in the movie. I watched it at night while everybody’s asleep. That movie scares the crap out of me. The picture was HD. The brightness was low. The sound was past halfway. It looked okay because Blair Witch Project has the female character video recording on an old camera. It looks like it looked the first time I watched The Blair Witch Project back in the year 2000. And I like that. Multi-tasking / browsing / usage Some sites like Yahoo take a while to catch up on uploading the page as I scroll further on some articles. I also encountered ads. I’ll have to use an ad-blocker. Battery life. The Mac was on for two hours and it dropped ten percent. All I did was setup and browsing. Then, I charged it by MagSafe charger. It took about less than 15 minutes to charge all the way up to 100% from 50% on first usage. Life expectancy: The 8gb ram should run well for the next 6 to 8 years. By then you and I or whoever chose this laptop will have upgraded in the next 5 years as technology further improves. And to size up my last thoughts… Oh yes, I used the box / case it came on as a laptop case to keep it stored at night so it won’t get dusty overnight. Simple as that. Put it back in its box. It’s brand new. You wouldn’t want to have a dirty starlight. Overall, if you have had an Apple device like a smartphone, tablet, or iPod touch back then, you’ll pick up on everything on your first go. Thanks for the read through on my review and to Amazon for this amazing machine. Farewell.",2022-08-24

 Literally just buy this. I’m a teacher and I have to have a dependable laptop.","The size is a perfect fit for my work bag. I bought this for my job, constant training online classes and zoom. The battery life is excellent. I can go two days without charging. The power up speed is faster than I expected. The ease of being able to switch between different screens is mind blowing.
I honestly used to buy cheap laptops and considered them after 2 years disposable.
Now that I’ve finally bought a MacBook Air I will probably never buy anything else again.","Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Literally just buy this.

 A Very Good Purchase","The MacBook Air M2 is a great laptop, with a fast chip and slim profile. Battery life is good. I bought the 13”, which is fine for my purposes. It arrived in perfect condition, and the champagne color is nice. I was worried that the champagne would be pinkish, but it’s really more silver, which I like. I wish Apple would put the USB-C ports on the right side instead of the left, making it easier to plug in a wired mouse when I use it at my desk. Overall, a very good purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars A Very Good Purchase,"The MacBook Air M2 is a great laptop, with a fast chip and slim profile.

 A reliable and capable laptop","I've had the Apple 2022 MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip for a few weeks now and overall, I'm pretty happy with it. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display is really nice, the colors are vibrant and the screen is super sharp. The 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage are plenty for what I need, which is mostly just browsing the web, checking email, and working on documents.

The Backlit Keyboard is a nice touch, it's really helpful when I'm working in low light. And the 1080p FaceTime HD Camera is great for video calls with family and friends.

I also like that it works seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad, it's really convenient to be able to start something on one device and pick it up where I left off on another.

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit pricey, and I'm not sure if it's totally worth it for what I use it for. But overall, it's a great laptop and I'm happy with my purchase. Also, the Starlight color is really pretty, it's a nice change from the usual silver or black.","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars A reliable and capable laptop,"I've had the Apple 2022 MacBook Air Laptop with M2 chip for a few weeks now and overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

    My Favorite","I really, really love this computer. I bought it because my old Air bit the dust, and knew I wanted another to replace it. The only difference that I genuinely noticed between this new computer and my old one is the sensitivity of the mouse pad. It took a few days for me to adapt to this new mouse pad, but once I did, I had no issues. Battery life is fantastic.

I bought it because my old Air bit the dust, and knew I wanted another to replace it. The only difference that I genuinely noticed between this new computer and my old one is the sensitivity of the mouse pad. It took a few days for me to adapt to this new mouse pad, but once I did, I had no issues. Battery life is fantastic.

    Apple Silicon Day is here!","I am going to go about this one a little differently.  There are tons of reviews and information on the Macbook Air out there.  No point in repeating them or disputing them, after all they are someone's point of view. I am going to come at this as a window user and a skeptic.First I heard about the Apple Silicon back when Apple debuted the M1 chip.  I think anyone that is being honest has to admit this is impressive.  The battery life and performance combo is great.  As a windows user who has never owned a macbook and who thought the Macbook Air was unattractive was not going to jump ship over the M1.  I do not like Apple's walled garden approach to their products.  I still thought the under 1k starting price was impressive for what you get.Fast forward to 2022 and Apple redesigned the Air and updated their M1 chip now calling it M2. I decided now I was going to purchase my first Macbook ( a small sale helped as well).Initial out of box experience was not great.  I bought the starlight color because I am tired of so many boring PC colors out there and when taking it out of the box it looked more silver.  I have long had a problem with AppleID (using Apple TV+) and had to revisit this frustration again. The update took over 30 minutes (Hello windows).  The trackpad was awful to use. Of course there was the whole unfamiliarity with MacOS as well.My second day was much better though.  I found how to adjust the haptic touchpad.  I became more familiar with the OS.  During the daytime the Laptop had a more light gold look to it. I downloaded google drive and Edge.  I was generally feeling better about my purchase.  Below are my thoughts.Reality:  The battery life and performance claims are slightly exaggerated. The battery life is good but to hit this high numbers you have to use it a certain way.  Using Edge browser for instance, with google drive enabled does produce a battery life in the 9-10 hour range that is well within some windows devices range.  Performance is real though with this being the fastest device to open ESPN website which is notoriously more demanding than most.The build quality is great with a sturdy feel and yet still thin enough. Most of the time it appears with a lot of manufactures you get one or the other (build quality or weight).Myth:  The display is really nice, but not any amazing OMG nice.  Plenty of other laptop makers have better displays.  Also while I thought the 2020 Air was unattractive because of its chunky bezels, the bezels on the 2022 model could still be shrunken on the side a little more. The notch does not bother me in the least.Myth 2: Windows laptops are obsolete?  No, there are better looking window devices out there that have better screens and a better design. Also you can find them a good bit less expensive when on sale.  The issue is most of them struggle to put forth such a complete package.Value:  I know they increased the price by $200 which is a lot without them increasing the base specs to match.  I got the base model and I am aware of the single nand performance of the 256 SSD. It is not as big of an issue as some make out and for everyday people (basic computer needs) it is meaningless.  I got my model on sale for 1099 total with taxes (sale with pay for the taxes promotion).  I feel that is a good price for the specs.  What I am not okay with is the absurd pricing that occurs once you add in more storage and memory.  This will quickly go up.  Just my viewpoint but whenever a non-gaming pc costs more than a powerful gaming pc it is too much.  Keep it $1200 or less for this one.MacOS: still learning it, so I won’t say yeah or nay on it just yet, but it is a different animal to windows. I do not like the way to activate the backlit keyboard, as there is no shortcut key, and it has to be activated through a menu.Conclusion:  There is a very short list of devices that hit it on all the critical parts of a device and the 2022 Macbook Air M2 does it. My understanding is that Apple keeps their design language the same for a while so buying this model you should not have to worry about a big redesign making this one feel dated anytime soon.Competition:  The Macbook Pro itself would be something to consider if you want more performance but the same OS and build quality.  Windows has quite a few competitors with the HP Spectre, Dell XPS, Lenovo Yoga, Asus Zenbook, and I am confident the Surface Laptop 5 will be a stunner with good performance, battery life, and 120hz refresh rate.Why is the MA2 a top choice for most everyday people?  It is the value of a complete laptop with a good display, battery, design, and performance.  Windows has so many choices and it can be hard to pinpoint which one to get, so that makes this the laptop of choice for most provided you are okay with MacOS.","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2022",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Apple Silicon Day is here!,"I am going to go about this one a little differently.

I got the base model and I am aware of the single nand performance of the 256 SSD. It is not as big of an issue as some make out and for everyday people (basic computer needs) it is meaningless. I got my model on sale for 1099 total with taxes (sale with pay for the taxes promotion). I feel that is a good price for the specs. What I am not okay with is the absurd pricing that occurs once you add in more storage and memory. This will quickly go up. Just my viewpoint but whenever a non-gaming pc costs more than a powerful gaming pc it is too much. Keep it $1200 or less for this one.MacOS: still learning it, so I won’t say yeah or nay on it just yet, but it is a different animal to windows. I do not like the way to activate the backlit keyboard, as there is no shortcut key, and it has to be activated through a menu.Conclusion: There is a very short list of devices that hit it on all the critical parts of a device and the 2022 Macbook Air M2 does it. My understanding is that Apple keeps their design language the same for a while so buying this model you should not have to worry about a big redesign making this one feel dated anytime soon.Competition: The Macbook Pro itself would be something to consider if you want more performance but the same OS and build quality. Windows has quite a few competitors with the HP Spectre, Dell XPS, Lenovo Yoga, Asus Zenbook, and I am confident the Surface Laptop 5 will be a stunner with good performance, battery life, and 120hz refresh rate.Why is the MA2 a top choice for most everyday people? It is the value of a complete laptop with a good display, battery, design, and performance. Windows has so many choices and it can be hard to pinpoint which one to get, so that makes this the laptop of choice for most provided you are okay with MacOS.",2022-09-12

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom. The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel. I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color. This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it. So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop. -if you want an M Series computer - get it. -if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it. -if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer -if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it -if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it -if you want all-day battery life- get it -if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it -if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.",2025-02-17

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit. I wanted to use Safari browser and now perfect for online searching , Netflix and Amazon Prime video. 2022 model I saved a couple of hundred bucks.","Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice laptop and solid as a rock,"First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever .

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it.

 Love this computer","I bought the Apple 2022 MacBook Air with the M2 chip two weeks ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at the price. I primarily use it for web browsing and software development, and I don't have many programs on it. Setting it up was seamless, especially since I have other Apple products. I encountered no issues during the setup.

The Midnight color looks fantastic and is the best quality Air I've ever used. The display and sound are great. While I haven't tried video processing, the M2 chip performs wonderfully. It's noticeably faster than my Mac mini with the M1 chip. I love the size and weight; it's perfect for bringing to the coffee shop. It also seems more durable than my girlfriend's 2020 Air.

The battery lasts at least 8 hours on a single charge, and I can use it at work for a significant portion of the day without needing to recharge. The new charging port style secures via a magnet, which works fine, though it could be a bit stronger.

Overall, I'm thrilled with the price, especially since I've never had a Mac under $1,000. I'm very happy with this purchase and give it 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Love this computer,"I bought the Apple 2022 MacBook Air with the M2 chip two weeks ago, and I was pleasantly surprised at the price.

 Best value","I would like to point out how the new MacBook airs have no cooling fans. I was initially worried the MacBook would over heat. However, I have the sims 3 with several packs and it runs flawlessly and barely gets hot. The MacBook is pretty quick to load and the battery life is amazing! The midnight color is beautiful, but just know that it is a finger print magnet.

 Frustrating, Challenging, and rewarding","Coming from a business environment I became proficient in navigating Windows system. We did use iPhones rather than android and I loved my iPhone. After retirement I purchased an Apple Watch on Prime Day and absolutely love it. I was somewhat bored I read a column indicating the Prime Days Apple promotion were legitimate. I was totally happy with watch purchase and thought this would be fun. Used my prime visa points and purchased. Glad I did. It’s different, challenging, and great little laptop. Great for amateur photography editing to create great photos by adding a frame for some family photos as stocking stuffers. Off topic but the Canon series 200 and Canon paper in a frame makes a great amateur photo. Available on Amazon. If Still learning a lot about Mac but depending on needs other than corporate use I like the little laptop better every day. I purchased the MS office suite for Mac because I wanted Excel, Word, and Outlook? Simple to install and have encountered no problems. Btw you cannot use your points if Apple Care + is included. It’s available from Apple and they will remind you. That little tip would have prevented wasting time with 3 customer service reps that had no idea. Just buy the laptop use your rewards, if you wish then get the care package within the time allocated and no problem.","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Frustrating, Challenging, and rewarding","Coming from a business environment I became proficient in navigating Windows system.

 A great choice for optimizing price versus performance","This is the perfect macbook air. No need to get an M3 processor when the M2 is fully capable of virtually all tasks, including scientific calculations. By choosing the M2 versus the new M3 version you save hundreds of dollars with virtually no loss in performance. The screen is clear and realistic, and you can watch a movie on it without compromise. My only observation is that the 256 GB SSD that I selected is not quite big enough and requires backing up pictures and music to keep enough space available. I recommend paying more to get 512GB. The 8GB RAM is more than adequate unless you need to manipulate video files.","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars A great choice for optimizing price versus performance,"This is the perfect macbook air.

According to college requirements this specific model is the mid range and very affordable. I did a lot of research and the best price I found was on Amazon and they also offer apple care. I wouldn't purchase this computer without apple care. It covers accidental breaks which with college students is necessary.,2023-06-08

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version. What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB. Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change. Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives. This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel. The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used. The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button. The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors. The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad. I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom. The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel. I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color. This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it. So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop. -if you want an M Series computer - get it. -if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it. -if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer -if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it -if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it -if you want all-day battery life- get it -if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it -if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.",2025-02-17

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever . I did not want a iphone just to play with the software so I am trying this macbook air 16gb. Very nice machine even though I only use it for online. I do enjoy learning mac os but surprised it did not do many of the features that Iphone has. I did not like the apple TV, Music or other apps on the unit.

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

However, only 7 weeks after receiving it, the keyboard and track pad both failed simultaneously and I had to take it to an Apple Genius Bar to be shipped for repair.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility?

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.) Size- I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience. So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it. Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs. Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight. Good luck, everyone!",2024-06-14

 Screen is Damaged after little useage","I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop. I have had one in the past and it worked out well.

 Excellent Purchase","I waited a couple of months before I posted this review. I wanted to make certain that I had no issues with my MacBook Air 13-inch laptop before I offered any comments.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time. However, my laptop arrived within 6 days to my surprise.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

Big problem because ios is different from windows you can't play a lot of games on steam.,2025-01-18

 Outstanding!","I purchased an Pavillion 16” laptop directly from HP. It took 2 week to arrive. I HATED it & returned it 5 days later.

I bought this MacBook on Amazon. I received it in two days. It was MUCH easier to set-up. Had a MUCH more intuitive operating system and was faster than the Windows 11 equipped unit.

The MacBook has a great keyboard. Very accurate and responsive touch pad. This computer is sleek, slender and light. The speakers are clear and the volumn can be set loud enough for enjoying movies and music. The screen is very clean, clear and the colors are vibrant.

I do not like the MagSafe charger connection. Happily, I can use a USB-C cable instead. I also wish this laptop had more ports. I also ordered a hub (not expensive) that gives me more ports than I will ever need.

I have been a Mac guy for 30 years. I have had and used several Windows computers over that time. For me, Mac continues to be far superior to any Windows computer I have ever used in business or at home.

This MacBook cost about 40% more than the Pavillion. It was money well-spent. I would have been willing to spend 100% more to not have to suffer through using that HP. Buy a Mac. Buy it from Amazon. Save the hassle, smile as you use your new computer!","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding!,"I purchased an Pavillion 16” laptop directly from HP.

The specs looked very similar to my old Pro, so I expected there to not be much difference in performance.  Boy was I WRONG.  This model is so freaking SLOW, it's unbearable.  Closing or opening new internet tabs, switching between internet browser and another window, etc all cause this thing to freeze up and show the little rainbow wheel of stupidity.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I went back on Amazon and bought a used 2019 Pro just like the one I had before.  Guess what - no issues.

 My first MacOS device.","My computer experience goes way back. I have had computers from Atari, Commodore, Amiga and PC dating back to the pre-Windows DOS configuration. This is my first Apple computer and my first laptop.

I have had my Macbook for a month now, and while there has been a bit of a learning curve, it isn't that different in basic operation.

For what I use the Macbook for, is deadly quiet (no fans), it doesn't get hot, even in my lap, and is very light to carry.

As a PC user, I was concerned about the RAM limitations, but I mainly I bought this laptop for basic use (Internet access, email, virtual meetings, occasional streaming on the road) For that kind of usage it works great. I still have my desktop PC, and will continue using it for my heavy lifting, although I am interested to try the Macbook for use in my photography hobby.

While I could have gotten a monster PC laptop for the same money, I have been curious about the Apple computers for a while, as I am nervous about the direction Microsoft is taking Windows of late.

So, this may not be my last Apple computer. Time will tell.","Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first MacOS device.,"My computer experience goes way back.

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password. Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.",2024-11-29

    Replacing a Macbook",Very happy to make this purchase at a discounted price over the holidays.  I bought this to replace an old Macbook Pro I had at a secondary property.

I'll add an external hard drive or find another way to connect it to my extensive music collection.  Now I have a computer to travel with if I want.

    Very nice computer","Let me start by saying I am not Apple's biggest fan - I've always used Dell or HP machines so this one has been a bit of a learning curve for me.

    An absolute workhorse Mac","Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air). It was bogged down running dj software and interacting with hard drives for music and running a web browser in the background and could not keep up for the life of it…. Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

 My first Macbook","I absolutely love this thing. It’s beautiful, works well, is customizable for what I’m interested in doing, handles tasks quickly and easily, makes working between it and my IPad a breeze, and has been a great intro to the world of MacBooks. I’ve never worked on one before and was a little worried I would struggle moving from a lifetime of PCs. I switched to an IPhone a few years ago for the camera and found I liked it and the native apps quite a bit. Along came an IPad. And when I needed a new computer I made the leap. I got this on sale around the Holidays and have absolutely fallen in love. It’s quick, versatile, looks and sounds great, and while it’s pricey, it’s around what I paid for my phone(which is a ridiculous price but I paid it so I guess I’m ridiculous) which is wild to me. I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My first Macbook,"I absolutely love this thing.

I bumped up the specs a bit and feel confident I have enough power and storage to last for years to come. I’ll update with how it holds up (I bought the midnight color and have heard mixed reviews on its lasting power), but thus far I’m extremely pleased with my purchase.",2025-01-20

 Incredible Machine","Beautiful hardware inside and out. Lightweight and portable but still incredibly smooth and fast. The latest MacOs runs flawlessly on this MacBook.

It has no issues keeping up with me and jumping between VS code, logic, safari, email, etc. handles anything you throw at it.

I haven’t tried any video editing, but I did play a bit of Civilization 6 and it runs great.

Battery life is phenomenal as with all the apple silicon.","Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible Machine,"Beautiful hardware inside and out.

 The best Apple product I've ever owned","I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them. It is incredibly fast, even when editing 4K video. I can have several Adobe apps open at a time, along with a bunch of internet tabs, and Obsidian and Movavi converting HD to 4K in the background, all fast, all beautifully executed. This computer has been running either On or in Sleep mode for three months and has not crashed. The screen is gorgeous, the sound quality is great, the keyboard and trackpad are exactly what you expect from a Mac. I have nothing bad to say about this computer. Not one thing. As a designer, video editor, and virtual assistant, it's a dream to work on and was worth every penny. Time will tell how long it lasts, but so far, I'm ecstatic that I own this machine.","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Apple product I've ever owned,"I've had tons of great iPhones and iPods, one iMac, one Macbook Pro, and one iPad, and this computer is genuinely the best of all of them.

 Best part is the battery life","I haven't used a Mac since using one of the old Airs in 2013. Since then I've been using a cheaper dell latitude for work and a razr blade for gaming. Now I am going back to school and needed something with better battery life that I couldn't really use for gaming. I can't stop finding excuses to use it because it's so nice, and the battery generally lasts multiple days without a charge which was almost shocking given that my dell and razr die in only 2-4 hours.

 Incredible bang for your buck!","As a long-life Windows user, I was a little bit unsure about changing to Apple's ecosystem but decided to try for once since my old Lenovo laptop was starting to have some issues with the lower ram it had installed.

I waited until Black Friday to snatch a discount and I have to say it was completely worth it!

I've never been happier with a purchase and I hope to have this laptop with me for a long time since its speed has increased my productivity by a lot! And it looks so good both aesthetically and visually. The screen looks gorgeous and the trackpad is the best I've ever tried on a laptop.

    How sensitive the screen is","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow. I saw marks on the blank screen and took a light rag to “wipe” it off only to see that every swipe I took left another non-removable mark. I realize now that the screen is soft. I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing. This was a lot of money for me. I would have searched for something different had I done my research. I’ve always been an Apple person, but…I dislike this very much. I like everything neat and tidy. This bothers me a great deal. Otherwise, so far, I love it.

    My First Apple Laptop","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars My First Apple Laptop,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

Poof, she finally went.In comes this newest model MacBook Air and by god she’s screaming’ fast. I was able to run dj software, have a web browser open, interact with a 5TB SSD with over 75,000 songs on it, stream music options through the DJ Software and have the DJ software analyze songs for BPMs, Key, and Stems (a new technology that can Remove vocals, beats, instruments, etc) without ANY ISSUES AT ALL.My first Mac was only a 13in but this 15in screen is well worth the size and space for multitasking and just overall Home Screen space. I just got it a couple of days ago (at the time of writing this) but the battery life is no joke and the entire laptop just looks amazing and sleek. I do love how smooth the laptop opens and closes and it’s not heavy at all. If you’re not interested in Windows then I do recommend this. It serves all my purposes functionality wise when it comes to music edits, cutting, mixing and DJing.The one thing I’m not entirely a fan of is the material the laptop is made of because it seems to mark up with smudges a lot easier but nothing a quick techwipe won’t fix!If you’re interested in speed, reliability, functionality, high tech features and more, look no further!","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars An absolute workhorse Mac,"Was in an immediate pinch when my DJ laptop finally crapped out on me (early 2013 MacBook Air).

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

 Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.

In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.

Specs-

I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)

Size-

I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.

So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.

Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.

Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.

Good luck, everyone!","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great laptop, too small for my workflow","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.

All I can really say is the it's an Apple product which I have found over the to be nothing short of excellent quality over the years. I am very pleased my purchase.

I would also add that when I made the purchase, the Amazon website stated that I needed to wait 4 to 5 weeks for delivery. This was prior to Christmas so I understood the wait time.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard.

    Very happy with my purchase","I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr. I had not narrowed it to a particular brand until about two months ago. After much research, I decided the Apple MacBook Air M3 fit exactly my needs.The construction of the aluminum case feels very study. I am finding the Apple system and support are a big plus. The laptop was super easy to set up for my needs.The battery charge last a long time. My last charge lasted 4 days. Now I’m not a gamer. I use my laptop for everything from communications on emails, some social media, watching news, reading research articles and doing some excel spreadsheets.I am very happy with my purchase. It is light enough for easy portability. I look forward to years of using the MacBook.I will add that if you have concerns about finger prints on the case, get the silver. I have had zero finger print issues with this color.","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Very happy with my purchase,"I have prepared for my purchase of a laptop for 1 yr.

    Awesome deal! Battery life is great!","Bought this one during Black Friday deals and it works great. Had to replace my old Macbook as the screen and battery was becoming faulty. In the interim, I was using an older laptop after I retired my Macbook. After getting this new Macbook Air, I was very happy that the battery life was so much better as I had forgotten how long it had been since I didn't have to constantly charge the laptop. I charge the laptop once every two days or so as the charge genuinely lasts that long. Even with a million tabs on my browser (yes, I am one of those people), there is no lag at all. The laptop barely gives off any heat at all even when I push it to run multiple programs.","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2024",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome deal!

I use my computer light to moderately for email, social and business related tasks and wasn't sure the purchase is justified but instantly, it's *such* and improvement. I didn't realize how slow my other computer had become. For me at least, this feels lightning fast, which saves so much time. I'm not waiting for anything, and the battery life is phenomenal. I've been using it lightly for a few days and have never had to charge and still have more than 50% batter life. I could travel for a weekend with no charger and be good to go. Chose the starlight color and do like it. It's more subtle than champagne, and in some lighting isn't a perceptible difference from the silver, but in full light it's noticeable and seems classy.

    Ok but not a serious work machine","Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all. This is basic functionality that Apple just can’t seem to get right. I had a similar problem with a MacBook Pro. After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn’t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times. Connecting monitors causes some windows to be relocated at strange places on the one external monitor it will accept at a time, sometimes almost completely offscreen. Why on earth is it possible to move a window completely offscreen to the point of inaccessibility? These are basic features that macOS bafflingly falls flat on.","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",3.0,3.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not a serious work machine,"Despite the product description saying that this MacBook can connect to dual monitors which the lid closed, I’ve found that the dual monitor support is finicky and sometimes doesn’t work at all.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

 Really nice laptop and solid as a rock","First macbook I have owned ,I have been a windows/android person for ever .

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it.

The battery life is exceptional, easily lasting a full day, and the lightweight design makes it perfect for on-the-go use.

The Liquid Retina display is stunning, and the keyboard and trackpad are top-notch.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity. So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents. You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you. I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer. Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version. What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB. Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change. Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives. This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel. The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used. The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button. The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors. The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad. I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom. The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel. I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color. This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it. So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop. -if you want an M Series computer - get it. -if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it. -if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer -if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it -if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it -if you want all-day battery life- get it -if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it -if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.",2025-02-17

 Love my MacBook","I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime. The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging. The screen size is normal and doesn’t have a border around it like previous models. The MacBook runs perfectly find especially with the m2 chip. I have had my MacBook for 3 weeks already and there has not been any scratches on it but if you get the midnight color it DOES collect a lot of finger prints.

Review Scale:

• 5 Stars = Exceptional, definitely recommended.
• 4 Stars = Reliable, worth considering.
• 3 Stars = Basic, but works.
• 2 Stars = Not ideal, think twice.
• 1 Star = Avoid, find something better.

My reviews are based solely on my experience with the product. I don’t communicate with sellers, and they play no role in my evaluation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2025",4.0,4.0 out of 5 stars Love my MacBook,"I love this MacBook DOWN but honestly it is like a normal laptop but with the features to text and FaceTime.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny.

They had never used a Mac before, but had used iPads, and had a small learning curve for these and were quickly comfortable using them on a daily basis.

 Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.

So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.

You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.

I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.

Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.

What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.

Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.

Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.

This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.

The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.

The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.

The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.

The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on. It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.

I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.

The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.

I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.

This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.

So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.
-if you want an M Series computer - get it.
-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.
-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer
-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it
-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it
-if you want all-day battery life- get it
-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it
-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025",4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

The MacBook is great for work/school and it is very light and easy to carry. The battery life is amazing and last me about 3-4 days without charging.

    Get this Macbook !","Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air. The lack of Magsafe and the annoying Touch Bar were my least favorite things about that model until this one came along. It brought back the magsafe port and I missed how svelte these felt when compared to other laptops. The 16Gb configuration might the best way to future proof it if you use it for daily mundane stuff. Battery lasts all day long and the speakers are pretty decent. 10/10 would recommend getting this one from Amazon, good pricing and fast delivery. I wasn't sold with the Midnight finish at first but it looks way better than the space gray.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Get this Macbook !,"Used to have an M1 MacBook Pro Late 2020 and I immediately regretted buying one over my older Mid 2012 Air.

    Great for school","This computer is great for people in collage or high school. Its light weight allows it to be moved around to many places, which allows me to easily bring it to my friends place to work on projects with them. And if you are doing simple things like scrolling the web or chatting with friends on a service like discord, then the battery life lasts a very long time. But the front facing camera isn't really up-to-par with the modern standards today. So if you plan to use this for zoom, or google meet you may want to consider a webcam if you really care about the camera quality. The screen quality is nice, the colors are vibrant and it can get really bright too. If you have an iPhone there are many useful features that connect the phone with the computer. Airdrop is nice when sending research links from my phone to my computer for school slideshows, it is fast and easy. Also, I can send messages to all of my friends from my Mac, and all of my contacts and notes are synced from my phone to my Mac too. But if you do not have an iPhone, I may consider a different brand because the Mac isnt good  with all of the Apple features like iCloud, and it would be a waste of money.","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for school,"This computer is great for people in collage or high school.

Everything syncs up beautifully!  The device is very fast and I upgraded to the 512gb SSD. You get the dual 35w charger with this and it charged mine from 50% to full in less than 45 mins while using it. The magnet charging cable is braided and color coded with a light indicator while charging. I am shocked how fast this machine moves and what quality the hidden speakers are. Phone calls and FaceTime are flawless. The new web cam is a welcome upgrade and the notch for it is subtle. The trackpad and keyboard are top notch and respond perfectly. This is worth every penny. I went with silver since that new midnight color is prone to scuffs and scratches showing. No fingerprints show on this silver and it’s a very classic look. If you’re on the fence go for it. You won’t be disappointed. No more windows stuff for me.","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",5.0,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing laptop,"Love how slim and light weight this is.
