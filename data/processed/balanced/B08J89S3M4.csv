So this is what we did and within a day of ordering the new battery the money was refunded back to us.  The computer is working wonderfully and we couldn't be happier.

    Update: Broke down after 1 year",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021","Update: I’ve been so dissatisfied with this laptop. I never use the touchscreen since it doesn’t react well. It’s always been slow, and all I do is streaming & internet browsing. And for nearly $300 it should last more than 1 year. With the price of fixing it I might as well just buy something better that I know will work.I’ve been happy with previous Amazon laptop purchases, but this one surprised me with how slow it was. I always look at the specs and assumed it’d be the same as the Lenovo I bought 3 years ago for the same price. This one is plastic instead of metallic, so it feels super cheap and I’m afraid it’ll break much more easily. I wanted to return it only to find out they charge a huge restocking fee, so guess I’m stuck with it till next time. Once I did all the updates, it did help a little, so definitely do those. The touchscreen felt strange, but it works so it’s fine. I think it’s just made from a cheaper material than I’m used to. Wish I had seen the other reviews like this before buying.",4,all,"Update: I’ve been so dissatisfied with this laptop. I never use the touchscreen since it doesn’t react well.

    Worked okay for 15-days",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2022","I bought this 15-days ago.  It worked fine for the first 14-days.

Then I tried to start my Oscilloscope APP and it wouldn't start, and I got the same Runtime Error 5:252.  So I looked to see if my windows was up to date, it is.

As a computer for anything else, it is almost worthless. The track pad for click and drag is unusable - sporadic and hard pressure is required to drag. The computer is abysmally slow, both loading and running programs. There is an appreciable hesitation when clicking on anything. Even cruising the web is frustratingly difficult due to the hesitations and track pad. The touch screen works fine though.",0

I always look at the specs and assumed it’d be the same as the Lenovo I bought 3 years ago for the same price. This one is plastic instead of metallic, so it feels super cheap and I’m afraid it’ll break much more easily. I wanted to return it only to find out they charge a huge restocking fee, so guess I’m stuck with it till next time. Once I did all the updates, it did help a little, so definitely do those. The touchscreen felt strange, but it works so it’s fine. I think it’s just made from a cheaper material than I’m used to. Wish I had seen the other reviews like this before buying.",0
