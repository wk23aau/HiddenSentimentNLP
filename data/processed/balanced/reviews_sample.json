However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers.

Will not use it for demanding software. It's slow. but in the acceptable range. It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode. S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 16}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    You get your moneys worth\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024\", \"body\": \"It\\u2019s a computer for $100 give or take.

Most surprisingly, it\\u2019s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that\\u2019s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam\\u2019s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn\\u2019t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities.I don\\u2019t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I\\u2019ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**\", \"helpfulVotes\": 89}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    So far so good,\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2025\", \"body\": \"Its a decent basic computer, at an unbeatable price,  lightweight and arrived on time.exactly as described.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    good functional computer product for price\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025\", \"body\": \"I am thankful this hP computer comes with windows already; however, the box was partially opened when delivered (see package delivery-person photo) but the actual computer worked well.

The screen quality was awful.  If you weren't looking at the exact perfect angle, the screen would appear faded out and the color would change.  It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.  I could never adjust my eyes to the color, and photos would look simply terrible.  My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.  The resolution was purported to be 1080, but the pixels seemed very large and most things appeared \\\"blocky\\\".  But the worst part of this computer was the performance.  Unbelievably slow!  Web pages would take forever to load, text would come in, and a bunch of white boxes would appear on screen until each image would load.  It is not my connection either, as I ran this computer right next to my Chromebook, which had none of these loading problems.  This computer was so slow that it would literally hang up while I was typing!  I would start to type a sentence, and nothing would happen on screen, then a few seconds later, the words would start to show up.  I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.

My first was the touchbar 2017 Macbook Pro, and that pales in comparison to this. As I've grown older, I have less of a need to use the processing power from the Pro models, and just need something light to carry around and do 90% of my work. This laptop is that, and so much more.I've been using this laptop very frequently for a little over two months now, and I'm in love with pretty much everything about it. I'm amazed at how light it is, while still feeling so, so premium. The metal curves around the screen and body feel so high quality when you graze your finger across them. One of the major gripes I had about my last Macbook was the keyboard -- the touchbar model keyboard was awful. The keys had a habit of failing occasionally. The new Macbook keyboards? Actually a keyboard now. Clicky and feel robust, a joy to type on! (which is something I thought I'd never say about a laptop keyboard)I am not a power user, I do not use this laptop for heavy rendering or 3D graphics. I do not game on this laptop. I have a desktop in my office for those things. This handles what I actually use a laptop for really, really well. I love that I can go to a coffee shop with this thing, pull it out of my bag, and instantly open up to my 15 open tabs from my previous session and continue to keep working. The speed is insane, and there are no hitches. The battery life also is incredible. Big fan of the braided cable that comes with this. At the moment, I can get a few days of heavy browsing use out of this, which coming from my old pro model that would die in less than an hour on battery with the same workload, is nothing short of a miracle to me. Praise the M series chips!The screen quality is super sharp too, I'm sure it's the same or similar screen to my old Pro model, but the bezels make up for it. Sure, it may not have Promotion, or whatever the Apple term for 120hz is nowdays, but I personally don't mind it, and don't notice it. Again, this is not a poweruser device.So, at the moment, this is an incredible deal on a laptop. I wish this was around when I was shopping for laptops in college, because this would have been a no brainer. Will this laptop handle the test of time with its great battery life and fast speeds? Only time will tell us, but at the moment, it's worth investing in.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 7}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Must buy!!)\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2025\", \"body\": \"Wow such a gorgeous laptop.

Just that extra little bit of vertical height provides an excellent aspect ratio and amount of space for working with documents and multiple windows.Other notable improvements: battery life is much superior, the device is super portable and lightweight, and the midnight finish is downright beautiful (even if keeping it clean requires a bit more work).My only wish is that the keyboard was quieter and more similar to the updated M-series MBPs.

I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.Specs-I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!\", \"helpfulVotes\": 102}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    High quality but questionable value and compatibility\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024\", \"body\": \"I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- \\\"Just works\\\" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in \\\"Midnight\\\" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable. A Windows Co-pilot Arm device, such as the Microsoft Surface Laptop is likely a better value in everyway unless your deeply invested in Apples Ecosystem.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 135}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Data Transfer\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2025\", \"body\": \"everything is amazing with this MacBook, it is like buying from Apple directly!

I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. I am able to share pictures and videos across all three Apple devices, which is why I chose the MacBook. The battery lasts for days, which is super impressive.What I don't like: The devices do not synch up as seamlessly as I thought they would. I am sure it is due to my inexperience with Mac laptops, but I would have thought it would all have been automatic with entry of my Apple ID and password. For me, the learning curve seems fairly steep, but it is because I haven't used a laptop of any kind in years (I've used only my iPad Pro) and have never used a MacBook at all.I am already happy with the purchase since the keyboard doesn't keep disconnecting like on my iPad Pro, making it necessary to utter profanities and throw the keyboard in the floor. (Not that I've ever done either of those things.) So I think it is going to be a good fit for me once I adjust to the fact that it is a laptop and not an Ipad and stop touching the screen!\", \"helpfulVotes\": 20}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Screen is Damaged after little useage\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2025\", \"body\": \"I like the idea of having a MacBook Air laptop.

After using 2 different adapters for each monitor, I got it to show both monitors briefly. But the other goes dark after just a few moments. Also, it wouldn\\u2019t let me connect to my Apple ID account during setup, instead freezing on login. Furthermore, it requires me to setup the keyboard every time I reconnect it through my USB-C adapter. Ridiculous. The window management is also confusingly stupid at times.

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 136}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great laptop, add SSD card for smoother gaming.\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025\", \"body\": \"I purchased this to play OSRS with HD graphics and was not dissappinted.

I am literally writing this review on this laptop in class.I just wanted a (Windows) laptop that I can code on and do a couple assignments while on campus. I never have to worry about the battery dying on me unless it was already really low. It is surprisingly fast but obviously not as fast as a $2000 laptop. Fast enough I would say.Right out of the box, I was instantly very surprised at how good quality everything felt and looked. It is actually pretty large in size but not cumbersome. But as I keep using it I do have some nitpicks about it:- The screen portion is pretty bendable to the point where I feel like you can easily break it. Now I don't know who would do that on purpose but you should watch out.- No backlight on keyboard makes it hard to see keys in low light.- Keyboard feels sort of hollow. Probably because it is cheap.- Fan is noticeably loud, say if the class is quiet. But I do prefer it to be cool and be a little bit loud than it be hot.- Fan ramps up randomly. Like I could have a simple assignment up with 2 tabs open and it could kick on for some reason even though the workload is not much. Then other times I have a bunch of tabs and another application open but it will stay silent.Other than that it is perfect if you need a cheap laptop to get some work done at school or code like me.

I Purchased my computer as a same-day delivery. it was a fast delivery and came as expected. I was excited to get it. I took everything out of the packaging and followed all the instructions.  When it came to connecting to the Internet I had issues. I followed the instructions on how to fix it it\\u2019s still wouldn\\u2019t connect I had to other devices that were connected to the Internet with no issues. so at this point, I called the number given in case there was connection problems. It was an automated machine asking for the SNID number. I put that number in and the automated system said that this product was no longer under warranty. Of course, my first thought was what the hell I just got it today. So at this point, I spoke to a live person who transferred me to the company, ACER. I spoke with a very nice gentleman, and gave him the SN ID number as well as the serial number. Come to find out the computer warranty expired in 2019. This was a refurbished device that sold as new. It was counterfeit. To no fault of Amazon. I was told to call Amazon back as he was unable to transfer me and once again, I explained my story. The customer service rep was named Rocky and he was absolutely awesome. He was very apologetic and said I was handling it well he gave me some options and I chose to have it replaced, I received a new computer the following day by 7:15 in the morning .  I\\u2019m sharing this as I want people to be aware that this can happen and of course it happens to me. Amazon customer service was awesome.Now, for my review, I had my old computer for years and years, which was a dell. This new computer is fast and I really like it so far. The only thing I don\\u2019t care for is the screen is not as bright as my dell was. It\\u2019s very lightweight and will be perfect for what I use it for. The sound volume is fine.

It performs pretty well and can even handle playing some games good. However the one thing that has really bothered me about this laptop is how loud it gets. I hate opening it in class because even if I just open one tab on Google, the fan goes crazy. It's incredibly embarrassing at times to use in class because of how loud it gets. I sometimes end up just turning it off and doing the work at home because of how loud it is. I don't know if it's just mine, and it's not like I have programs running in the background or anything like that, this can happen anywhere from when I first open the laptop to sitting idly on a blank Google doc with nothing else opened, it doesn't matter. But it's just unbearable to deal with sometimes.Another comment I have is originally I was expecting to get the gray laptop as advertised in the pictures, but when it arrived it was a navy blue. I'm not complaining though, it's pretty.Overall though I think it's a pretty good laptop and it does everything I need it to do. For the price it's great, and i think this laptop really excels at home where you're not worried about the constant noise it creates.

Honestly speaking, this laptop isn\\u2019t that great, but it\\u2019s good enough for what I need it for, which is good enough for me. For $300, and even less on sales. You can do some light office/college/business work, light browsing, and very very light gaming on low setting. Unless it\\u2019s an old MMO, you could probably get away with medium or higher, but don\\u2019t expect much. This thing may have \\u201c8\\u201d gb ram, but in honesty. You\\u2019re probably going to have around 3.5-4gb ram free, as window system will eat majority of it. My biggest complaint is that you can\\u2019t upgrade the ram, it\\u2019s sadly soldered on. Unlike the storage, which is upgradable, but do know you\\u2019ll have to reinstall window. The casing feels \\u201clight\\u201d, very light, enough to where to I don\\u2019t want to apply too much pressure as it might deform or bent it in a way, maybe cheap material. The display is\\u2026.. uh do able? It\\u2019s very dim and the color is like off, very off, don\\u2019t expect to do any artsy stuff with correct colors. As for battery, it leaves a lot to be desire. Depending on what you\\u2019re doing you could be around 2-7hr battery life, so make sure to always keep it plugged in. The keyboard is fine, it\\u2019s nice to have a laptop with the side pad, it\\u2019s something I use for when I do light gaming. Other than, it\\u2019s a pretty all rounder budget laptop for a cheap price.

It's slow, sometimes freezes up with basic programs, and you can't upgrade RAM, which really hurts. Very misleading descriptions and advertising for this product. There are several similar model options, be very careful when comparing.Pros: Cheap, which is the big selling point here. Easy initial setup, boots quickly, lightweight, display quality is not horrible, decent battery life.Cons: It's slow...like really slow. I get stuck waiting to click on internet links, navigating back and forth between pages, and when using software programs...waiting for the computer to respond, and occasionally having to reboot. This is with plenty of space on the hard drive, also. The fact that you can't upgrade the RAM is really frustrating,the 8gb dual chips are soldered on, no way to change or upgrade.There is no backlit keyboardor touchscreen toggling, despite what the Amazon descriptions might lead you to believe. Sound quality from the onboard (tiny) speakers is horrible, even with my very low expectations for that. Super \\\"tinny\\\" and low volume.Overall, very disappointed.

I\\u2019m personally not a big fan of the size, it also wasn\\u2019t very slim. It was extremely difficult to fit in my laptop bag even though the bag was made for a 20 inch laptop such as this one. It\\u2019s very bulky in my opinion. When I turned it on it was already having issues. The noise from the fans is INSANE!!! If you want a quiet laptop for school I do not recommend this at all. It was super noisy. The other issue I had is that the computer was CONSTANTLY using half of the ram and due to the computer having 8gb of ram, that only left 4gb for anything else you need to do. Opening up browsers or really anything was super slow. It wasn\\u2019t easy to use at all. I ended up factory resetting it twice and it helped a little bit but not much. Pretty much the only thing that was good about this laptop was the keyboard. It was pretty nice and had a quiet sound. The laptops condition wasn\\u2019t great when I got it either. It had scratches in some areas. I ended up buying a refurbished dell laptop and it worked so much better.If you want to try this out for yourself go ahead, but I personally did not enjoy a second of the headache this laptop caused me. Returning wasn\\u2019t easy either and I found out this store is a third party store so the only way to return it is to print out the shipping label and wait for UPS to come by your house. You aren\\u2019t really given a time they will be there either and they definitely aren\\u2019t willing to work with you on it. So be prepared to stay home all day.On a good note it did come early!Edit: Forgot to mention, the computer comes on something called \\u201cS Mode\\u201d it basically blocks anything and everything that isn\\u2019t Microsoft based.

There is another model with the same id but the last 4 alphanumeric of the product is the key factor in its performance upgrades. this is capped at 8gb.

From the moment I unboxed the device, I encountered significant issues that rendered the laptop unusable.The primary issue was that the laptop failed to load properly right from the start. Upon booting up, it would either freeze on the startup screen or get stuck in an endless loop of restarts. This made it impossible to access the operating system or complete any setup process.Another major problem was the keyboard, which simply did not work. No keystrokes were registered, making it impossible to type anything or navigate through any initial setup screens that did manage to appear. This is a fundamental flaw, as a functional keyboard is essential for any laptop.While the build quality seemed decent upon initial inspection, the severe functional issues overshadowed any potential positives in this area. A laptop that doesn't load or register keystrokes is essentially a non-functional piece of equipment, regardless of how sturdy or sleek it looks.I immediately contacted customer support to address these issues. The support team was unresponsive and discourteous, they were unable to provide a solution that resolved the problems. As a result, I had no choice but to return the laptop.The Acer Aspire 3 laptop failed to meet even the most basic expectations. With severe loading issues and a non-functional keyboard, it was clear that this device was not ready for use.If you're in the market for a reliable and functional laptop, I would advise looking elsewhere. The Acer Aspire 3 did not deliver on its promises and resulted in a frustrating and disappointing experience.

For the graphically interesting games natively compatible with it, very good graphics performance. The display is amazing and is capable of twice as many pixels as it shows you. It was a good value in a Black Friday sale (~$1400), but this (M4 Pro 12/16) chip is on par with or under performance of the prior generation M3 Max 14\\u201d, so if it can get one of those for a good deal refurbished or open box, there is no shame in it. As with all M1/2/3/4s, there are dedicated neural cores for Apple Intelligence to run, which allows for a personalized Siri who listens to you and watches you all the time, without sharing this information. You can disable Apple Intelligence and Siri, but after I got past the creepiness, I configured Siri as an Irish Female, and it makes everything lovely. There is a lot of integration with other Apple devices, like you can operate your iphone from a distance on your MacBook. You can also receive texts and Messages from your iPhone, and easily use it for tethering, as a substitute for your webcam (the webcam is pretty solid nonetheless). This model supports linking hearing aids and also supports airpods much in the same way the iPhone does. You can easily use your living room TV as a second monitor on the fly, and if you can plug in via HDMI, you can get the whole 4K@120hz. MacOSX is a great operating system, built on Unix, and with tons of room for customization for beginners to super users. Time Machine backups with your own plug-in hard drives and iCloud are incredibly convenient. Safari gets better and better, but the Mac versions of Chromium and Firefox also dazzle.For most programs that aren\\u2019t games, macOSX is widely supported, but if you just *need* it, parallels desktop and vmware can run windows for you.New users ought to pay close attention to Tips and go into settings and learn all the trackpad gestures. You won\\u2019t want to come back to a different trackpad, and until you want to game, you will not care to use a mouse.Anyway, I got this for my wife as a gift, partly because she needed a new computer and partly because I wanted to convert her.

I thought this 2024 model would be faster. I don't see any difference. I also had trouble deleting an installer app, which has never happened before with my old MacBook. There were errors in the file somehow, so it could not be dragged to Trash. Had to Google to figure out how to delete it (found it under Applications). I also thought getting a new laptop would make on the road internet connection more seamless. Nope. Same issues I had with my old laptop. I was able to connect with my hotspot, but then suddenly it just didn't work. Tried to reconnect again and it didn't work. Tried to pair my iPhone 15 Plus with my new laptop and it couldn't find the device under Bluetooth. Still need to figure out this part.PROS:The laptop itself is beautiful and feels a bit heavier than the 2015 model. I wanted to get black, but ended up with silver again because I was afraid of fingerprints. The charging block (with MagSafe) is smaller than the 2015 model. Love the long battery life because I edit photographs and those editing software drains the battery. The battery on my 2016 laptop is still alive by the way (after 9.5 yrs), but after 2 hrs of Lightroom use it needs to be charged.CONS:I don't like that the speaker holes are on top (where the keypads are) because it looks like it is easier to get messed up for accidental water spills. The speakers on my old laptop is hidden somewhere (maybe in the hinges of the fold). So be very careful with snacking/drinking around your laptop.Some new features I noticed compared to the 2015 model is that the mouse pad has a clicking feature. Before I just had to tap around, but now the corners of the mouse pad are like mouse clickers. I don't like it yet because I am not used to it. The whole laptop feels less responsive to me because of it, but it was easier for my husband to use because he is a PC/windows user and was always frustrated using my 2015 MacBook because he didn't know how to tap on the mousepad.I hope this laptop lasts me another decade like my last one did, but with the speaker holes on top I don't think the lifespan will be as long.The laptop comes with 1/2 the battery charged. I haven't charged it yet. With my old laptop I always leave it charged even when not in use.

The process was so fast at about 1.7 GB/s, and I had 200GB out of the 256GB old storage.Storage:Having a 512GB base storage is so nice compared to juggling with 256GB the last 4 years. The M1 MacBook Air is/was an excellent budget laptop during grad school even with the base 256GB storage. However, I'd always struggle to offload and download files when I got more photography gigs, especially dealing with RAW files. I averaged 200GB on and off, so seeing that I am still less than half of the 512GB storage now is comforting.RAM:The 16GB of RAM flies through my workload with ease. No more \\\"Swap Use\\\" Memory from the former 8GB RAM I had, which is a plus. I throw all sorts of demanding tasks including Google Chrome, LightRoom, Ableton + Nexus, LogicPro, FruityLoops Studio, etc. Still under the 16GB usage.My thoughts:Typing this on the new M4 MacBook Pro, and it is noticeably a better experience for my productivity and day-to-day workloads. This isn't even the \\\"M4 Pro\\\" or the \\\"M4 Max,\\\" and I am happy with it. Worth every penny.Overall, this is perfect for anyone who is a student, a creator, an artist, or anyone who just loves the efficiency and convenience of being in the macOS atmosphere.

I really didn't like the keyboard layout that with every key raised with light shinning through at the bottom. If laying down watching a movie, all you see is light emitting out of all of the keys which is very distracting and uncomfortable. The keys make a ton of noise in comparison to other versions of Macbooks which was a HUGE DEALBREAKER for me. I did think of buying keyboard cover but then hesitated knowing that they get loose over time and fall off. The mouse pad also makes extra noise and uncomfortable to the touch when using even though I did think of a solution of buying a mouse pad sticker which meant I had to spend more of my personal time shopping around and waisting more money to fix a solution for an expensive laptop with major flaws. The keys on keyboard all have open spaces which was concerning due to the fact that it would become dust and particle collection trap, not to mention higher risk for damage if something is spilled onto it by accident. The keys on the keyboard that I received were all raised to a different level, I could see varying amount of light coming through on all of the keys, THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE RETURN. This laptop was also a little bit thicker which I could have gotten used to but still unappealing. I was so disappointed with this model and will be making sure to stop by a brick and mortar store next time to test out the future models in person prior making a purchase from Amazon. Other than that, if this computer was gifted to me free of charge or if it costed under $200, I would most likely buy and keep it, find mouse pad stickers and keyboard covers, buy them in bulk and use them over the years when the old ones go bad.

I really didn't like the keyboard layout that with every key raised with light shinning through at the bottom. If laying down watching a movie, all you see is light emitting out of all of the keys which is very distracting and uncomfortable. The keys make a ton of noise in comparison to other versions of Macbooks which was a HUGE DEALBREAKER for me. I did think of buying keyboard cover but then hesitated knowing that they get loose over time and fall off. The mouse pad also makes extra noise and uncomfortable to the touch when using even though I did think of a solution of buying a mouse pad sticker which meant I had to spend more of my personal time shopping around and waisting more money to fix a solution for an expensive laptop with major flaws. The keys on keyboard all have open spaces which was concerning due to the fact that it would become dust and particle collection trap, not to mention higher risk for damage if something is spilled onto it by accident. The keys on the keyboard that I received were all raised to a different level, I could see varying amount of light coming through on all of the keys, THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE RETURN. This laptop was also a little bit thicker which I could have gotten used to but still unappealing. I was so disappointed with this model and will be making sure to stop by a brick and mortar store next time to test out the future models in person prior making a purchase from Amazon. Other than that, if this computer was gifted to me free of charge or if it costed under $200, I would most likely buy and keep it, find mouse pad stickers and keyboard covers, buy them in bulk and use them over the years when the old ones go bad.

That said, it's a letdown for those who have used Intel processors especially for those of us who are asking \\\"what did I just pay $3k for?\\\" - really, it's maybe the same speed as my old one, a few things are chirpier but many things are also slower.  I don't run weird software or anything, and everything I use is Apple Silicon-compiled so Rosetta doesn't get in the way.

Great Gaming Laptop!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023\", \"body\": \"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16\\\" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!\", \"helpfulVotes\": 219}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Decent laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025\", \"body\": \"I have had no technical issues with laptop so far and everything seems great.

Expect high framerates and few frame dips thanks to high CPU limits, but with a few caveats.Pros:1. It is insanely fast and quiet. Balanced mode fans are around 40 dB (about as quiet as a desktop) but you can make them run much louder in Turbo mode.2. Good display. The 165Hz screen is quite good and fast, slightly better gamut then my previous laptop. The 16:10 ratio is also really nice for games and productivity apps. Mine has a slight green tint but only when using the iGPU, switching to Nvidia removes it. Which means it's probably a software issue (see \\\"Cons\\\" below)3. It runs cool. While playing endgame Dyson Sphere Program (basically a CPU stress test) the CPU doesn't even reach 80 degrees and manages to squeeze out 60+ fps where my old Ryzen 7 4800H would crap out and struggle to cough up 35 fps.Cons:1. Asus software is horrible, it's like it was coded by interns. This is the main reason I took one star off the review, out of the box MyAsus and Armoury Crate hog CPU and RAM and are constantly fighting against Windows' settings and each other. They can cause constant freezes and weird bugouts like the screen colors going haywire. Even after replacing them with G Helper, there are still a few lingering issues I have to be wary of.2. Bad battery life. Out of the box it runs like 5 hours max, 4 hours if you disable the screen battery saver (60 Hz is nauseating). Definitely going to need to lug that huge power brick around.3. The middle fan is very high-pitched like the ones you'd find in thinner laptops. It can be distracting for some, personally I'm on the fence. It is still very quiet and even gets drowned out by external speakers or headphones.4. Gaudy design. The lightbar is obviously annoying and the keys are pretty much unreadable without backlight on, which I really hate. The 4-zone RGB keyboard is also poorly executed, it looks patchy and has very limited color range. Typing on it feels very good though, it has full-size keys, high travel and good feedback. I just wish it had a numpad or a dedicated Home, End, PgUp and PGDown keys, there's a lot of wasted space on the deck.Overall I'm still very happy with my package, would recommend it to anyone who wants a well cooled laptop with insanely high performance with a tradeoff of portability and battery.And Asus, please fix your damn software.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 46}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    NOT 16 inches\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025\", \"body\": \"My sister and I were both getting new laptops and my sister chose this one. Right off the bat we noticed how much smaller it was than anticipated. For reference, I previously had a 15inch computer and quickly saw this looked much smaller and I was correct.We measured and it\\u2019s approx 13.5 inches with an active screen of about 13inches.This was really important since we needed laptops that would fully utilize the cintiq 16 aspect ratio and laptops of a smaller size usually results in a smaller working area on the tablet.My sister still wanted to try and see if 13 inches would be enough and sadly it was not. It\\u2019s a big shame too because the laptop seems very well made. I\\u2019ve had an ASUS in the past and it lasted me a while so I trust the manufacturer. The silent fans really ARE very silent.

If you don\\u2019t mind getting a laptop that\\u2019s three inches smaller than anticipated then this seems like a good choice. If size does in fact matter to you then please look elsewhere. But also keep in mind, this isn\\u2019t the only wrong size listing. The Acer 17 laptop I got was in fact 15 inches despite the description. 15 at least uses the full Cintiq work area so I didn\\u2019t need to return mine but again it\\u2019s weird that you have to assume that what\\u2019s listed in the description is going to be off by two to three inches.

This laptop does everything I need and more! I've used it on games like World of Tanks, Fortnite and Call of Duty. The 16gb ram handles everything with no issues! I've recently started using it for some astrophotography processing and again, it does everything I need with no issues.I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but for the price and since most of the reviews were positive, I went ahead and pulled the trigger. And I'm glad I did! I have always bought from Dell and I was leaning that way again this time. Nothing against Dell, I've always had great success with them. But, for the price and what I got ... ASUS may be my new go to!If there is any downside, it would be the keyboard. The function is great, the lights are pretty cool, even though I just needed them be backlit, but the colors are ok too. But the only downsides to me are the Q,W,E,R,A,S,D and F keys are clear which make them hard to see. I assume it was done that way since they are the ones used most in gaming, but it's just an annoyance to me. The other issue is I would prefer a number pad on the right-hand side of the keyboard, this one doesn't have that. But neither issue is a deal breaker for me.I love this laptop!

No creo que sea un problema grave.-A veces las aplicaciones fallaban, se congelaba y se reiniciaba solo (no suced\\u00eda muy seguido).

As\\u00ed que recomiendo reinstalar las apps de Windows, restablecer la BIOS al modo fabrica y reinstalar Windows (que es lo pr\\u00f3ximo que hare porque estoy seguro de que solo es problemas con Windows que tal vez se configuro mal durante la instalaci\\u00f3n)*No me gusto la parte de atr\\u00e1s ya que viene con relieves lo que dificulta usar soportes, es por eso que tuve que colocar los soportes uno mas abajo que el otro para poder nivelarlo, pero recomiendo colocar soportes en la parte de atr\\u00e1s para que el aire pueda circular mejor, adem\\u00e1s que tambi\\u00e9n sirve para que el cable del cargador pueda bajar un poco para que no se caliente por la salida de aire (como esta en la imagen).*En cuanto a juegos Assassin's creed syndicate en gr\\u00e1ficos m\\u00e1ximos da hasta 60 fps (es el \\u00fanico juego que he instalado hasta ahora).*La pantalla no es de tan alta resoluci\\u00f3n si eres exigente en ese aspecto, pero se mira muy bien.*La bater\\u00eda dura 2 horas mirando peliculas, que es lo normal en laptop gamer (en armoury crate en modo gpu, viene seleccionado \\\"est\\u00e1ndar\\\" recomiendo seleccionar \\\"optimizado\\\" que har\\u00e1 que la RTX se desactive y solo use la grafica integrada) esto har\\u00e1 durar un poco mas la bater\\u00eda, tambi\\u00e9n activar el ahorro de bater\\u00eda.*un consejo, si no te reconoce la RTX, intenta cambiando el modo gpu en armoury crate.En resumen, me gusta mucho este port\\u00e1til y fue una buena compra.

There is 2 things I want to point out. This gaming laptop has upgradable memory ram with 2 slots. Asus indicates that the maximum memory that can be installed is 32gb. I did a lot of research and I had messaged Crucial since the memory cards or sticks what ever you want to call them are compatible with this laptop. I asked if the 64gb which comes in a kit with 2x32gb sticks is compatible with the asus rog strix g16 g614jv model, they replied back to me and confirmed that \\\"YES\\\" this laptop memory ram can be upgraded to 64gb. How ever you have to buy the one that has the same speed as what the laptop has, since this laptop has a DDR5 4800hz sodimm stick that's what you're going to have to get. The memory ram comes in multiple of 2, i.e. this laptop comes with 2x8gb (16gb) .. If you want to add 32gb then you would have to get the kit that comes with 2x16gb and then 2x32gb (64gb). I upgraded to 64gb and had no problems installation was easy. Id did take about 3-5 minutes for the laptop to recognize the upgraded memory ram. Now same thing goes with the SSD storage Asus indicates that maximum storage is 2tb. I bought the 4tb Samsung 990 evo plus and installed it as the main Boot up OS C: drive. Of course you have to clone the SSD drive that come with the laptop but my point is that you can upgrade the SSD to 4tb. With this new upgrade my laptop is a beast. This laptop is worth it.

I love how you can even play with 100 FPS or even more in some games (Halo infinite,  Apex Legends, The Finals) with the silent mode (without overheating or having the max power of the CPU/GPU). If you want to get over 100+, the turbo mode (taking full advantage of the GPU/CPU) will be great + the 165.1 Hz. The only \\\"issue\\\" (not issue honestly if you do not see this as problem) is the turbo mode makes the laptop sounds a bit loudly which is normally when you are utilizing it with the full capacity. Other than that, you can have an amazing experience playing on this mode.This version specifically does not have the numeric pad included. I originally thought it was going to be, but the i9 version has it, this one does not.Sound experience is good enough considering this is a gaming laptop, but by using headsets, the sound changes considerably, so good point to have the direct connectionWifi is the fastest and best one I've ever seen personally. I have played online getting 80+ pin (considering I'm from Colombia and pin does not get below that normally) easily. The experience can change a bit with cable, but there is not a big change at least on my end. Long story short, wifi is really attractive if you do not mind losing or having some ms more.Finally, this is something NOT related to the laptop. When I placed the order, I trusted on the platform by adding \\\"automatic\\\" location. This caused a delay of 5 business days. I contacted Amazon and the delivery company and Amazon could not change the shipment address because it had been already shipped. After several back and forth calls, none of the companies was able to support or make it faster which I understand, but I felt super uncomfortable knowing my order was in my city and Amazon did not attempt to address the situation.  So please be careful and I recommend to add the location manually BEFORE making the order.If you are looking to jump into a medium/high performance laptop with no more than 1,500, this is a great option.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 40}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Shipped to Kenya...i love it\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2025\", \"body\": \"Shipped this item to Kenya, the laptop runs so well, and i wont push it sooo much to its limits so the battery lasts longer\", \"helpfulVotes\": 1}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Laptop\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2024\", \"body\": \"Great Laptop, goog quality sound and screen, good graphics performance, nice finishing, not too heavy, not so noisy (as others said) for me, however NOT 2024 model\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great Gaming Laptop!!!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2024\", \"body\": \"Going on a little over a month of owning it I kept forgetting to write a review but such a GREAT laptop, it works so fast, smooth and has great graphics.

It has been a smooth-ish experience. It is amazing for the price. I like that it can run all my games, and I have also used it for programming. It is definitely good as an all-rounder. The battery life is unexpectedly good. Once it reached more than seven hours, which is supreme for a Windows machine. I like the large trackpad. The RGB is also a good addition. Though the laptop becomes loud in turbo mode, I find myself keeping it on either silent or balanced mode, depending on the FPS I am trying to achieve.It runs Cyberpunk max settings with path tracing at 80 FPS native resolution with DLSS Quality at 70 FPS. I can confidently say it can run every game out there at max settings.The only downside is the SSD. Maybe it is just my model, or I am not sure, but the laptop becomes extremely slow while downloading games from Steam, Epic Games, etc. It is almost unusable. Task Manager shows disk at 100% while showing only 50 MB/s writes, which are initially 200, etc. I am not sure about this, but it is not much of a hassle. I only notice it when games are updating or installing. I guess they had to cut corners to make this such a great price. The Black Friday sale made this laptop even more worth it. I paid 1300$ because it had to be shipped to Qatar. It is much cheaper than the alternatives here, though, so worth it.Overall, I am giving this laptop a 5 stars. If only the SSD was better, this would be a perfect laptop. I guess I will probably buy a better SSD later, as this laptop has two NVMe slots.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 25}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Size matters\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2025\", \"body\": \"The media could not be loaded.\\n                \\n            \\n                \\n            \\n            \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Very nice!

My HP played Baldur's Gate 3 at an average of a whopping 7 fps and that was a painful experience. The load times were god awful.

I usually get somewhere between 42 fps and 63 fps minimum now during my sessions. The Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail benchmark also runs beautifully, which I'm very pleased about since the whole point in upgrading my computer was so I met the minimum requirements for Dawntrail when it releases.The packaging for this laptop was really nice. Opening it was just as much of an experience as turning it on for the first time. The keyboard feels great when typing and I love that the little bumps that help you figure out where your fingers are without looking includes W.

Everything was working perfectly until one random day it was struggling to run pretty much every single game in my Steam library, even on minimal graphics settings.At this point I've done everything but replace the motherboard on it: driver reinstalls, complete device wipe, plugged it into multiple different power sources. I've taken it to people 3 different times, each of them all did something different and none of them were able to solve the issue. At this point I'll have to send it in to Asus, which is massively inconvenient for me because they ship through FedEx, arguably the worst mail system to curse this planet.I have my suspicion that this is because of the Intel processor fiasco that happened in early 2024 where the CPU's started to burn themselves out, as I've been told multiple times my issue is supposedly a processor issue.

Anyway, I set up Windows and rebooted after the first round of Windows' updates.  It booted into the bios on the section for flashing the bios.  Weird.  I didn't interrupt the boot process.  It did have a message to plug in the laptop even though it was 95% charged.  I exited the bios and powered off/on.  Same thing.  I decided to plug it in and powered off/on again and let it along.  After 10 or so minutes, I see what you see in the video.  Seemed like it wanted my attention so I press a key and there's Windows.  Ok, that looks good.  But why is it flashing like that?  Windows had been updated and loaded.  There was nothing that told me I needed to do anything.  So I let it be and after a minute or so, it went back to the flashy process in the video.  I pressed a key and logged into Windows and everything was fine after that.  I'm not sure why this thing had to flash like that just to tell me Windows was ready to log in to.Aside from that, it seems like a great machine.  It's built like a tank without being too heavy.  Screen is pretty.  The few games I tried (American Truck Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator, Mars 2030) played beautifully.Anyway, maybe that's a silly reason to give it 3 stars.

Everything I've thrown at it, it's played very well. The new 40 series graphics cards features really help with this. The laptop is sturdily built with no deck flex around the keyboard. The screen is 1200p which is a little more than FHD and in the 16\\\" size it looks great. No lightbleed and a strong contrast ratio. Yes you can easily open it up and replace the memory and add another m.2 SSD. The memory is dual channel and the m.2 size is the full length size. Yes the thing is quiet even under some light load. Of course the fans will ramp up if you throw something very demanding at it BUT looking at temps for the CPU/GPU show that it's very well cooled. I haven't seen the CPU go over 85c nor the GPU over 65c as of yet.The power plug is in an odd spot though, it's in the center of the right hand side and with the power brick being so large that might cause trouble for some when trying to position it somewhere. There's an odd issue with the 3.5mm headphone jack where using an earbud with an inline microphone can cause some weird sound issues. Upon looking online I see that low impedance headphones might suffer from these sorts of issues on certain laptops. In my testing using expensive headphones with high impedance show no sign of this issue so that could very well be the issue. I also find the trackpad can be a bit funky, it will sometimes not register clicks and more frequently won't register two finger scrolling correctly.

I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw.

However, after about 5 months of owning this device, I noticed that there was a blatant performance issue with games that had intense requirements for graphics processing that wasn't present when I initially bought the device. Everything was working perfectly until one random day it was struggling to run pretty much every single game in my Steam library, even on minimal graphics settings.At this point I've done everything but replace the motherboard on it: driver reinstalls, complete device wipe, plugged it into multiple different power sources. I've taken it to people 3 different times, each of them all did something different and none of them were able to solve the issue. At this point I'll have to send it in to Asus, which is massively inconvenient for me because they ship through FedEx, arguably the worst mail system to curse this planet.I have my suspicion that this is because of the Intel processor fiasco that happened in early 2024 where the CPU's started to burn themselves out, as I've been told multiple times my issue is supposedly a processor issue.

Windows had been updated and loaded.  There was nothing that told me I needed to do anything.  So I let it be and after a minute or so, it went back to the flashy process in the video.

It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.The larger problems, to me, are that the touchpad is absolutely massive, way bigger than my old laptop, and I have to keep it disabled constantly because it's way too easy to accidentally press when typing, and that the screw for the second M.2 SSD slot cannot be removed. I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw.

I've been satisfactorily using Windows 10 on two 17-inch laptops (an HP and a Lenovo) for several years. But when Microsoft announced not supporting WIN 10 and encouraging the installation of WIN 11, I knew I would have to \\\"bite the bullet\\\" and upgrade before I ended up having to buy Windows 11. WIN 11 comes pre-installed. I've become accustomed to using Office suites since the mid-90s (okay, okay I'm now 78).  Free pre-installation of the latest of the non-subscription Office suites (2024) was a big plus when considering the purchase of this new laptop.  I hope I'm all set for the rest of my life.  I was also looking for a laptop that--as I age--I could much more easily carry around the house than I can right now carry my 17-inchers.  (It could also be easier to carry when I pack up other personals if ever notified to evacuate due to fire, wind, or earthquake.) Also, realizing that I didn't necessarily need a 17-inch laptop any longer, I chose a less expensive 15-incher. By the way, validating the pre-installed Office 2019 is easy. Just don't hurry, read everything on the screen as you work toward validation, and you'll be done with that step in four minutes! Watch that you do not install Microsoft 365 'cause you'll have to pay for and subscribe to it. If you don't need it, then Office is truly adequate for you. The legal pre-installed version of Office 2019 is genuine Microsoft software that does not come with a product key and, therefore, it does not need to be registered with Microsoft.  (If you have an online Microsoft account, it's up to you if you want to register the laptop itself.)  One more thing, once you're done with setup process, you'll notice that OneDrive is the default for synchronizing. If you're not familiar with OneDrive, go online to understand what it's for and how it works. Contact the seller via Amazon's communication feature for anything. Just click his name on the right side of the product description page and you'll arrive at the seller's profile with the link for communication in the upper right corner.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 23}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Strong Hardware - Questionable Office Setup\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2025\", \"body\": \"I purchased three of these laptops (1 for me and 2 for my church) to replace non-upgradeable Windows 10 computers.

So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on.  It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.-if you want an M Series computer - get it.-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it-if you want all-day battery life- get it-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 37}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love it\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025\", \"body\": \"Great specs, great computer for day to day basic stuff.

For DAYS?And let's talk about how FAST this thing is.

I know people complain about only 256GB storage, but with cloud stuff I haven't had issues?Anyway, I'm rambling, but seriously\\u2014I was eating ramen for two weeks after buying this and DO NOT REGRET IT.

My laptop arrived seemingly brand new right out of the box. I plugged it in and began setting it up. Within about 15 minutes, the screen started glitching so I left it charging and put the laptop aside.Over the next three days, the laptop wouldn't hold a charge. The amber light on the charger would light up for a few seconds, the laptop would automatically restart, and it would shut down again. I tried using different outlets, surge protectors, chargers, and even charging ports. Nothing worked!I went immediately to an Apple Store to have them look at the laptop. This is where the red flags started to appear. I was told that if the laptop was defective, they could replace it...until they found out I bought it from the Apple Store on Amazon. I was told that buying Apple products from 3rd party vendors like Amazon is \\\"really dangerous\\\". I waited to talk to a technician. What I learned is that Amazon buys products from Apple and then re-sells them. My warranty, which is usually good for a year, had only 38 days left. And the computer had a hardware issue. If I asked them to repair the laptop, it would void what little warranty I had left.I immediately tried to initiate a return. I could not return the item without speaking to Amazon customer support. After repeatedly chatting and talking with two separate agents, neither of whom could easily assist me, I finally had the return approved.I happened to be sitting outside an Amazon pick-up/return counter at Whole Foods, but I soon learned that they could not process the return. I needed to re-pack the laptop, print and place a mailing label, and take it to USPS. When I went to USPS, I realized that I needed to pay $24.80 in shipping costs. And since I don't live in the continental U.S., it is now being sent via cargo ship. It will take at least 3 weeks to arrive. I will then need to wait 14-30 days before receiving my refund...if the package is not damaged.

My laptop arrived seemingly brand new right out of the box. I plugged it in and began setting it up. Within about 15 minutes, the screen started glitching so I left it charging and put the laptop aside.Over the next three days, the laptop wouldn't hold a charge. The amber light on the charger would light up for a few seconds, the laptop would automatically restart, and it would shut down again. I tried using different outlets, surge protectors, chargers, and even charging ports. Nothing worked!I went immediately to an Apple Store to have them look at the laptop. This is where the red flags started to appear. I was told that if the laptop was defective, they could replace it...until they found out I bought it from the Apple Store on Amazon. I was told that buying Apple products from 3rd party vendors like Amazon is \\\"really dangerous\\\". I waited to talk to a technician. What I learned is that Amazon buys products from Apple and then re-sells them. My warranty, which is usually good for a year, had only 38 days left. And the computer had a hardware issue. If I asked them to repair the laptop, it would void what little warranty I had left.I immediately tried to initiate a return. I could not return the item without speaking to Amazon customer support. After repeatedly chatting and talking with two separate agents, neither of whom could easily assist me, I finally had the return approved.I happened to be sitting outside an Amazon pick-up/return counter at Whole Foods, but I soon learned that they could not process the return. I needed to re-pack the laptop, print and place a mailing label, and take it to USPS. When I went to USPS, I realized that I needed to pay $24.80 in shipping costs. And since I don't live in the continental U.S., it is now being sent via cargo ship. It will take at least 3 weeks to arrive. I will then need to wait 14-30 days before receiving my refund...if the package is not damaged. And after the three weeks it will take for the package to get sent back to Amazon, the return window will have closed.Meanwhile, I purchased a newer model version of the same laptop directly from Apple. It is refurbished, but will come with a warranty and tech support. I will pick up my new laptop in two days...for less than the entire cost of receiving a defective laptop and mailing back the return at my own expense from Amazon.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 4}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Waited so long to upgrade and it ended in disappointment\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2025\", \"body\": \"I have been sadly disappointed.

It's easy to use, the battery lasts all day long (like 10-12 hours), and the functionality is superb! The sound quality is amazing, the graphics are amazing and I'm now a Macbook convert!  The only negative is the weight.  It's a bit heavy for a laptop, but I knew that when I ordered it.  It's super fast, so its the guts of the machine that make it weigh more!  I'd buy it again.  It was a great value for the money\", \"helpfulVotes\": 11}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Powerful. Bit heavy. Quality through and through, as expected from Apple.\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025\", \"body\": \"I've owned this MacBook Pro M4Pro for a few weeks, and very impressed with the power and design. I do have to admit that it's a bit heavier than I expected. My previous laptop was an intel MacBook Pro, 15 inch retina. But, the trade off for larger and better quality display, and the performance gains of apple silicon are more than worth it.I got the 48gb ram, to help future proof. Also, it'll come in handy for my apps (video editing, 3D modeling/animation). So far, activity monitor reveals low memory/cpu usage.  I also chose the 512gb storage. Yes, I would have liked more storage space, but the Apple premium is expensive. I opted to get thunderbolt 4 & 5 external ssd drives. The thunderbolt 5 ssd drive actually delivers write/read speeds faster than the internal ssd.The space black is not as dark as I expected. However, it does have a serious, elegant appearance. Does it collect dust and fingerprints? Well, I really haven't noticed fingerprints. Yes, if the cover is closed, and it sits for a few days, you'll see some dust. To be fair, it's the same amount that falls on anything else, including a silver MacBook Pro. A simple wipe clears it away. Using a microfiber cloth does a great job for dusting, btw.Even though the 16 inch is large and has a bit of heft, I value the larger screen real estate over a 14 inch screen. The laptop mainly stays at home. So, size and weight is not a major consideration. I do like the form factor for the flexibility for travel. (I was considering getting a Mac mini M4Pro, and a case. But, decided on the MacBook Pro. With the possibility of going Mac Studio M4 variety later in the year.)Overall, very pleased with the MacBook Pro.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 14}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Love it!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025\", \"body\": \"Arrived 2 weeks earlier than expected!The laptop was boxed and packaged with care as well so there were no damages (thank goodness because I was afraid that would happen)I LOVE my new Mac!

Screen, touchpad, fingerprint scanner, battery life, and noise of fan are all much better than my mid 2015 model. The sound quality from this laptop is very impressive comparing it to my last. I bought the most powerful version I could without building one with more storage which is more computer than I personally will ever need. I bought the highest end version for my mid 2015 model and it still runs flawlessly today (secondary computer now). I was slightly disappointed that this new computer with greatest M4 processor and upgrades, didn't run any faster than my old version for normal tasks. None-the-less it is a great computer and I love using Apple products. Price is the biggest catch for me buying Apple. With similar features on a Windows computer you can get a lot more bang for the buck. Issue I have always had in Window computers (most expensive versions I could buy) are viruses and constant problems that lead to needing a computer store to fix which is limited in my area. I have never taken either of my last 2 MacBooks to someone for repairs which is insane when they both still run. Hope this one keeps me running for 8-10 years before the next. The biggest issue I have with the the new is the weight of the computer. It is a tank and it thicker than my 2015, but the size are nearly the same but having a 16\\\" screen instead of 15\\\". I would have really liked to see a touchscreen version, maybe coming this year unfortunately after I already bought this version.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 5}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Looked for a laptop and found it\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2025\", \"body\": \"Costco had too much of a laptop that I didn't need and Apple was worse.

Apps open and run just that much more quickly, I really enjoy the noticeable uplift in Wi-Fi speed with 6E, and the screen on this latest MacBook is much better than on the M1 Max that I had in that the pixel response time is noticeably improved. That was a complaint I had when I originally got my M1 Max 16\\u201d back in 2021 because pixels would smear more noticeably when scrolling.

As a long-time Apple enthusiast, I was eagerly anticipating this release, and it has truly lived up to the hype. From its sleek design to its powerful performance, this laptop is a game-changer for professionals and creatives alike.First and foremost, the display is a standout feature. The Liquid Retina XDR display is stunning, with vibrant colors and incredible brightness that make everything from photo editing to watching movies an immersive experience. The high resolution ensures that even the smallest details are crystal clear, which is essential for graphic designers and video editors. I found myself staring at the screen longer than necessary simply because it was such a pleasure to use.Performance-wise, the new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips are nothing short of revolutionary. The speed and efficiency are remarkable, allowing for seamless multitasking. I can run demanding applications like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Creative Suite without any lag, which has significantly boosted my productivity. The battery life is also impressive; I easily get through a full day of work without needing to recharge, which is a huge plus for those on the go.The keyboard is another highlight. The improved Magic Keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience with excellent key travel, making long writing sessions much more enjoyable. Additionally, the audio quality is outstanding, with rich sound and clear speakers that enhance music and video playback.In terms of connectivity, the return of ports like HDMI and an SD card slot is a welcome addition, catering to the needs of creatives who rely on various peripherals. Overall, the newest MacBook Pro is a stellar combination of performance, design, and functionality. It's a worthwhile investment for anyone who values quality and power in their tech.

They don't try anything fancy with this one which for me is a positive. Plus it's TKL keyboard which really should be the new norm. Does not have a backlit keyboard which is a slight miss but for the price it's not a huge deal.You can take it out of S-mode easily and remove a lot of the addons and you have yourself a perfectly functional Windows machine.

As someone who is always on the go, I needed a reliable laptop that could keep up with my busy schedule, and this laptop has exceeded all of my expectations.Let's start with the design - this laptop is sleek, lightweight, and portable, making it perfect for carrying around campus or taking to meetings. The 14\\\" screen is the perfect size for both work and play, and the Intel Quad-Core N4120 processor ensures that everything runs smoothly and quickly. The 8GB of RAM and 192GB of storage (64GB eMMC + 128GB Micro SD) provide more than enough space for all of my files, photos, and videos.One of my favorite features of this laptop is the 1 Year Office 365 subscription that comes included. Having access to all of the Microsoft Office programs has made it so much easier for me to stay organized and productive. The webcam is great for virtual meetings, and the HDMI, WiFi, and USB-A ports make it easy to connect to external devices and accessories.But what truly sets this laptop apart is its incredible value for the price. I was a bit hesitant at first because of how affordable it is, but I can confidently say that this laptop is worth every penny. The performance and quality are on par with laptops that cost twice as much, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.In conclusion, if you're a student or a business professional in need of a reliable, efficient, and affordable laptop, with amazing battery life, look no further than the HP Newest 14\\\" Ultralight Laptop. It's a 5-star product that will truly make your life easier and more enjoyable.

If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by \\\"Deal\\\" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365.

Design. The keyboard is set unnecessarily high. There doesn\\u2019t need to be that much space at the bottom of the keyboard. It\\u2019s not ergonomically functional. I am a writer and I frequently lose paragraphs at a time because as I\\u2019m typing my palm slides over the touch pad and highlights text. I often find myself wondering what happened to a whole block of text.

The Chromebook still  consistentlyrestarts by itself every few days after I close the lid to put it in sleep mode, thus wasting time booting up when I try to continue reading the next day. Chrome OS has forced automatic updates which I didn't think too much of before, but the last 2 updates broke compatibility with the SD card in all apps. This includes Google's official \\\"Files\\\" app from the Play store, published by Google themselves, the same company who makes the operating system. This has wasted 4 or 5 frusting hours at night when I want to kick back and relax by reading a bit since I have to debug why I can't get any apps to read from my SD card even though it was working perfectly fine the previous day before the Chromebook restarted by itself and updated itself even though I don't want it to. I am currently trying to debug the SD card not working for the second time this month now and I am just tired of this garbage. If you just want a Chromebook to browse the web, this is good. But try to use it for anything else or try to use an SD card with it, and I do not recommend trying this. Stick with an Android tablet from a good brand or an iPad. It is a shame because the hardware from Acer seems good, but the operating system is just garbage and there is no way I can give this anything higher than 1/5 when it can't even do the most basic of tasks to just open image files from a SD card.[Original review for 3 stars]:I only bought this to mainly use as a tablet for reading. I download a lot of content for offline reading so I use a SD card, but the chromebook seems to have issues when leaving the SD card in it. When I wake it from sleep, it will show a warning saying I shouldn't remove the SD card without safely ejecting it first, but the SD card is still inserted and was never removed (I live alone so noone else would have touched it). No data can be read from the SD card at this point and I have to take it out and put it back in. I thought it was a bad SD card at first and tried another SD card but it had the same issue. After some googling it turns out other people had the same issue. This makes using this chromebook a lot more annoying since I have to remove and reinsert the SD card every time I want to use it.The chromebook also randomly reboots when I open it up, although it happens pretty rarely (maybe once or twice a month). The battery percent is still always higher than 30% after booting up, so it didn't run out of battery. I assume this might be related to leaving the SD card inserted, but I don't want to take out the card since micro SD cards are very easy to lose.Overall using the chromebook is good - things load pretty fast and the touchscreen isn't super responsive but is fine for the price point. However, I bought this purely for using with a SD card so these issues make it much more annoying for me to use.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 28}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    A Good Small Reliable Laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2025\", \"body\": \"I really like this small but fast computer.

I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.  The apps are a shame, but honestly, given the price point here, it's a good deal and I can live with it.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 134}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Pr\\u00e1ctica\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2025\", \"body\": \"Buen tama\\u00f1o y con buen espacio para guardar cosas\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Decent\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2025\", \"body\": \"Works as expected, the volume doesn\\u2019t get high at all.

I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I'll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I'm kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could've put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don't like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don't expect to do much gaming as it doesn't have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you'd expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I'm a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it's just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I'm tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn't seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I'll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn't a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn't bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it's a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn't have (stylus and second camera). Also look at the true reviews closely as this thing is offered with the Intel CPU (N4020), and AMD CPU, and a MediaTek CPU.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 340}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great product fast shipping\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2025\", \"body\": \"Great product\", \"helpfulVotes\": 1}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Few Ports\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025\", \"body\": \"Got it, was excited but it only has 1 USB port and 1 port that's a C port for power.

I purchased it because of it's price and convertible design. The limited internal storage space and poor camera are the biggest drawbacks in my opinion. Depending on what you plan to use his for, this might be a great low cost option. There are a lot of other devices out there in this price range though. I think it's important to find out what features matter most to you before you decide.Pros:-Low Cost-Convertible Design (My favorite feature)-Good web browsing performance (haven\\u2019t had any issues streaming videos or having multiple tabs open)-Good battery life-Ability to install most of the apps available in the Google Play store.Note: Minecraft is not currently available unless you are planning to use the education edition (in case that\\u2019s something you were hoping to play) and some apps are not properly optimized to be used in landscape mode (this seems to be an issue with android apps in general, so I don\\u2019t fault this particular device).Cons:-Only 32 GB internal storage. 13.3 gb are used by the system. This doesn\\u2019t leave much room for installing apps. Maybe I\\u2019m missing something, but I haven\\u2019t found a way to move apps to the SD card. So far, I\\u2019ve only been able to select the SD card as the storage location for downloads within apps. For example, I can tell the Netflix app that I want to store downloaded videos on the SD card.-Camera quality is extremely poor for video calls. It's dim and grainy. Using extremely bright lighting helps some, but the graininess is still noticeable.-1366x768 Screen Resolution. This isn\\u2019t a deal breaker for me, but I do notice the lack of a full HD screen more than I thought I would on a screen this size. This may not be an issue for most users.-Heavy/Bulky in tablet mode. I primarily use this as a laptop with a touchscreen that has a keyboard that I can tuck away for watching videos or playing games. That's what I was looking for, so this works for me. If you are looking for something that is comfortable to use as a tablet, you'd probably be better off getting a 2-in-1 Chromebook with detachable keyboard or a tablet with a keyboard case.Overall, I'm happy with the value and performance of the Acer Chromebook Spin 311.

After three years, it stopped updating, and its functionality slowly deteriorated. Some websites won't load, and making purchases is limited to certain sites. During this summer's Prime, I searched for a replacement. The Acer seemed like a reasonable replacement.Within a day of receipt, I had trouble staying connected to my internet. I work from home for a creative agency using a Mac and my partner is a video editor who uses a PC. We have never had issues staying connected on the other three laptops. I searched reviews and Reddit and made some recommended adjustments but nothing worked. I reached out to Acer hoping they would be able to troubleshoot but they needed me to FedEx it to TX. At least they provided a shipping label and the kind folks at FedEx gave me a free box. I arrived overnight and was shipped back to me the same day. Suspiciously fast! The notes on the paper left in the box were a little condescending. It appears they replaced a few parts. I know they didn't have time to really test it! Sure enough about a day into using it and I wouldn't stay connected to the internet. Frustrating! I called Acer again and their solution was to have me ship it back. At that point, I was pretty annoyed. What were they going to do that they didn't do the first time? Shipping it 5X is not cost-effective. Why not just send me a new one??????? Also, I've been without a personal laptop for a few weeks now. So the guy said a supervisor would call me. It took 10 days of phone tag (a different very frustrating story) We spoke on a Tuesday. He said I had to ship it but he'd expedite and make sure I'd get it back by the weekend. It was back in TX for 12 days. So 2 weeks later I got the laptop with an even more condescending note that says they replaced the motherboard. At this point, with parts, shipping, and labor we're way beyond the cost of a new machine! AND I'm well past the window to just return it through Amazon. So now I'm stuck with this laptop that WILL NOT stay connected to the internet. I will be in the middle of something and have to reboot. And BTW Acer didn't follow up once to see how it's going. Horrible service, garbage laptop. My next personal computer will be something else!My Samsung has never had this issue.

It does this almost daily. Kind of annoying.End of update\\u2022\\u2022\\u2022I am not a tech person, and I have never had a laptop before. I broke my leg and ankle and have been bed bound. Also friends want to do zoom and I only have my iPhone which isn\\u2019t the best for zoom. I decided I needed a laptop to use as I heal and recover. Not having any experience I had no idea what to get, I knew I wanted something that was also a touchscreen. It had to be easy to use. I did some research and hadn\\u2019t planned on getting a chromebook. But I read the reviews for this Acer chromebook and the price was good for my budget. When I got it, I was happy to find that it is easy for me to navigate. I quickly set it up with Netflix and Amazon Prime, the picture quality for watching shows and movies was great. Perfect size for me while I\\u2019m stuck recovering in bed and can\\u2019t watch tv in the living room. Zoom is so much easier now with this versus my phone screen. I like the game apps and it\\u2019s made being bedridden a lot more bearable. And once I am recovered, it will still be a nice addition for me with how easy it to use the keyboard or flip to use the touchscreen.As someone who doesn\\u2019t do well with computers, I found this to be very easy to use with a nice picture.The sound seems to come from the bottom of the Chromebook, so it isn\\u2019t super loud. Which is for me another plus. I\\u2019m sound sensitive so I turn on the closed captions on my TV when I watch it, so I have done the same with the Chromebook.

She already has an iPad , but were told by the school iPads were not allowed and they recommend a Chromebook.  We purchased this one based on reviews and limited supply.The Good:The Acer Spin 311 has good build quality and feels like a solid device.  The hinges have an appropriate level of resistance to keep it from flopping around.  The buttons and keyboard feel really good for a laptop of this price.  The screen resolution, color and brightness were all acceptable.Setting up the Spin 311 was easy and when our daughter logged on with her School Gmail account everything was there.  Google docs, drive, and classroom all worked out of the box.  We tried to print, but our old Canon was not supported, but I attribute that to the very old printer and not the Acer.The Bad:The Acer Spin 311 seems incapable of streaming anything.  On her first day of school after about an hour she complained Zoom kept freezing up.  We have a Netgear Orbi mesh network with strong signal and ISP with 100 up / down.  I checked the WiFi speed / signal strength at her desk and everything checked out.  The only way she could get the Zoom to work was by turning her camera off.  Normally this would have been a disappointment but the camera is such poor quality, no video was probably better than the grainy image we got with it.Later I tried to stream a movie from our home Plex server which was 29Mbps in original format to see if it was maybe the Zoom app or the internet.  The Acer Spin 311 could not get more than 5 minutes in without freezing up.  Having the server trans-code the movie to around 20Mbps I could finally get it to play, but somewhat jittery.  I tried both the Plex web app and native app with the same result.Summary:If you are going to just edit documents and surf the web, the Acer Spin 311 is probably fine, but I have to imagine you can get other Chromebooks for cheaper that can do that just as good.  If you try to video conference the terrible camera image and inability to stream any normal video is a deal breaker.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 34}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Well priced.

This purchase has been extremely disappointing due to significant discrepancies and deceptive practices.Firstly, of the three laptops received, only one was a genuine Gateway brand. The other two, despite having the same model number, were clearly different, non-Gateway units. This immediately raised concerns about the accuracy of the product listing.Secondly, and more alarmingly, the battery specifications were inconsistent. The genuine Gateway laptop had a 45-volt battery, while the other two had 30-volt batteries. This difference in power supply is a major red flag, suggesting these are not equivalent products.Adding to the frustration, the sellers had placed labels directly over the system information stickers on the non-Gateway laptops. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the true specifications and brand of these devices. This practice is highly suspicious and dishonest.I am deeply dissatisfied with this purchase. The products received do not match the advertised description, and the attempt to hide the system information is unacceptable.

The Chromebook still  consistentlyrestarts by itself every few days after I close the lid to put it in sleep mode, thus wasting time booting up when I try to continue reading the next day. Chrome OS has forced automatic updates which I didn't think too much of before, but the last 2 updates broke compatibility with the SD card in all apps. This includes Google's official \\\"Files\\\" app from the Play store, published by Google themselves, the same company who makes the operating system. This has wasted 4 or 5 frusting hours at night when I want to kick back and relax by reading a bit since I have to debug why I can't get any apps to read from my SD card even though it was working perfectly fine the previous day before the Chromebook restarted by itself and updated itself even though I don't want it to. I am currently trying to debug the SD card not working for the second time this month now and I am just tired of this garbage. If you just want a Chromebook to browse the web, this is good. But try to use it for anything else or try to use an SD card with it, and I do not recommend trying this. Stick with an Android tablet from a good brand or an iPad. It is a shame because the hardware from Acer seems good, but the operating system is just garbage and there is no way I can give this anything higher than 1/5 when it can't even do the most basic of tasks to just open image files from a SD card.[Original review for 3 stars]:I only bought this to mainly use as a tablet for reading. I download a lot of content for offline reading so I use a SD card, but the chromebook seems to have issues when leaving the SD card in it. When I wake it from sleep, it will show a warning saying I shouldn't remove the SD card without safely ejecting it first, but the SD card is still inserted and was never removed (I live alone so noone else would have touched it). No data can be read from the SD card at this point and I have to take it out and put it back in. I thought it was a bad SD card at first and tried another SD card but it had the same issue. After some googling it turns out other people had the same issue. This makes using this chromebook a lot more annoying since I have to remove and reinsert the SD card every time I want to use it.The chromebook also randomly reboots when I open it up, although it happens pretty rarely (maybe once or twice a month). The battery percent is still always higher than 30% after booting up, so it didn't run out of battery. I assume this might be related to leaving the SD card inserted, but I don't want to take out the card since micro SD cards are very easy to lose.Overall using the chromebook is good - things load pretty fast and the touchscreen isn't super responsive but is fine for the price point. However, I bought this purely for using with a SD card so these issues make it much more annoying for me to use.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 28}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Few Ports\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2025\", \"body\": \"Got it, was excited but it only has 1 USB port and 1 port that's a C port for power.

After three years, it stopped updating, and its functionality slowly deteriorated. Some websites won't load, and making purchases is limited to certain sites. During this summer's Prime, I searched for a replacement. The Acer seemed like a reasonable replacement.Within a day of receipt, I had trouble staying connected to my internet. I work from home for a creative agency using a Mac and my partner is a video editor who uses a PC. We have never had issues staying connected on the other three laptops. I searched reviews and Reddit and made some recommended adjustments but nothing worked. I reached out to Acer hoping they would be able to troubleshoot but they needed me to FedEx it to TX. At least they provided a shipping label and the kind folks at FedEx gave me a free box. I arrived overnight and was shipped back to me the same day. Suspiciously fast! The notes on the paper left in the box were a little condescending. It appears they replaced a few parts. I know they didn't have time to really test it! Sure enough about a day into using it and I wouldn't stay connected to the internet. Frustrating! I called Acer again and their solution was to have me ship it back. At that point, I was pretty annoyed. What were they going to do that they didn't do the first time? Shipping it 5X is not cost-effective. Why not just send me a new one??????? Also, I've been without a personal laptop for a few weeks now. So the guy said a supervisor would call me. It took 10 days of phone tag (a different very frustrating story) We spoke on a Tuesday. He said I had to ship it but he'd expedite and make sure I'd get it back by the weekend. It was back in TX for 12 days. So 2 weeks later I got the laptop with an even more condescending note that says they replaced the motherboard. At this point, with parts, shipping, and labor we're way beyond the cost of a new machine! AND I'm well past the window to just return it through Amazon. So now I'm stuck with this laptop that WILL NOT stay connected to the internet. I will be in the middle of something and have to reboot. And BTW Acer didn't follow up once to see how it's going. Horrible service, garbage laptop. My next personal computer will be something else!My Samsung has never had this issue.

She already has an iPad , but were told by the school iPads were not allowed and they recommend a Chromebook.  We purchased this one based on reviews and limited supply.The Good:The Acer Spin 311 has good build quality and feels like a solid device.  The hinges have an appropriate level of resistance to keep it from flopping around.  The buttons and keyboard feel really good for a laptop of this price.  The screen resolution, color and brightness were all acceptable.Setting up the Spin 311 was easy and when our daughter logged on with her School Gmail account everything was there.  Google docs, drive, and classroom all worked out of the box.  We tried to print, but our old Canon was not supported, but I attribute that to the very old printer and not the Acer.The Bad:The Acer Spin 311 seems incapable of streaming anything.  On her first day of school after about an hour she complained Zoom kept freezing up.  We have a Netgear Orbi mesh network with strong signal and ISP with 100 up / down.  I checked the WiFi speed / signal strength at her desk and everything checked out.  The only way she could get the Zoom to work was by turning her camera off.  Normally this would have been a disappointment but the camera is such poor quality, no video was probably better than the grainy image we got with it.Later I tried to stream a movie from our home Plex server which was 29Mbps in original format to see if it was maybe the Zoom app or the internet.  The Acer Spin 311 could not get more than 5 minutes in without freezing up.  Having the server trans-code the movie to around 20Mbps I could finally get it to play, but somewhat jittery.  I tried both the Plex web app and native app with the same result.Summary:If you are going to just edit documents and surf the web, the Acer Spin 311 is probably fine, but I have to imagine you can get other Chromebooks for cheaper that can do that just as good.  If you try to video conference the terrible camera image and inability to stream any normal video is a deal breaker.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 34}, {\"title\": \"1.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Disappointing Purchase: Mismatched Laptops and Hidden System Information\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025\", \"body\": \"Review Content:I recently purchased three Acer Gateway Chromebook 311 CBO311-1H-C1MX laptops from Amazon. This purchase has been extremely disappointing due to significant discrepancies and deceptive practices.Firstly, of the three laptops received, only one was a genuine Gateway brand. The other two, despite having the same model number, were clearly different, non-Gateway units. This immediately raised concerns about the accuracy of the product listing.Secondly, and more alarmingly, the battery specifications were inconsistent. The genuine Gateway laptop had a 45-volt battery, while the other two had 30-volt batteries. This difference in power supply is a major red flag, suggesting these are not equivalent products.Adding to the frustration, the sellers had placed labels directly over the system information stickers on the non-Gateway laptops. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the true specifications and brand of these devices. This practice is highly suspicious and dishonest.I am deeply dissatisfied with this purchase.

There are a ton of YouTube video reviews, so I will not go into all of the details - you should definitely watch them first, but here are my pros and cons:Pros:You can use it like a regular laptop, and it is totally stable and the keyboard is *great*.The OLED screens are beautiful and bright (though reflective in bright light).The vertical mode is super stable and easy to get used to.Moving apps between screens is simple, and I have had no problems at all.In \\\"standard\\\" mode, I almost never hear the fans, even with multiple programs running.The system uses a small 65W power brick...any 65W or higher PD brick will be fine.The premium body is not a fingerprint magnet.Battery life seems good, but I have not used it too much without ACComes with the active pen, but I have no use for itThe MyAsus application is very good, and puts the system controls in one placeCons:Heavier than your usual 14\\\" laptop, but you have 2 screens :-)Two Thunderbolt 4 ports - why not TB 5?The keyboard battery life when removed from the body seems a bit short when the backlight is onThe CPU can take more power, but it is limited in this machine to prevent it from throttling too muchBattery life is limited due to the two screens, but that is to be expectedWhy not Win 11 Professional instead of Home for a premium device?There is only 1 M.2 slot for storage, which is a bummerOverall, this is one of the best machines I have ever used.  Applications are quick, and I am never waiting for something to respond.  This is NOT a gaming machine, regardless of what you might hear.  The iGPU is not the best that Intel has to offer, and the NPU for AI is weaker than most - but for what it is meant to do, it excels.

I purchased this model: (HP 255 G10 Laptop, Ryzen 3 7330U, 15.6\\\", 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD with Windows 11 Pro) from the seller Chromebook Prosale via Amazon for $399 in December of 2024.I had to return the first one because it had a RAM error. Every other time I started it, the Caps Lock LED would blink (3 long and two short). According to the documentation, that meant a RAM issue. Might have just needed a cleaning or the RAM was installed improperly. (more on that later.) I'll never know because I didn't want to void the warranty. So I sent it back and the seller promptly sent a new one. No errors on that one. YAY!Booted it up and it indeed had no errors, recognized all hardware, and had Windows 11 Pro installed. All good. Pretty quick. WiFi has typical range. There are two USB ports, one HDMI port, and one 1/8\\\" audio jack. Battery holds a charge like a champ. No security port. However, I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop.Being satisfied, I then voided the warranty and opened the system to take a look. (I don't recommend this for the casual user because, though I'm not sure, I think it will void your warranty - if they find out that is!)Now the interesting part:TLDR: Be careful when buying from third-party sellers. You might save money, but you never know where the laptop has been or whose grubby paws were inside it!See attached image of the RAM. Note that only one stick is covered with a sticker. This leads me to believe that HP built this laptop with 8 GB of RAM (1 stick) originally. I can't prove it, but I think that the seller (or another intermediary) installed the 2nd stick of RAM to bring it up to 16 GB. Three clues led me to this deduction (which is guesswork): 1 - the lack of a sticker. That's weak sauce, and HP QA would probably not let that pass before leaving the manufacturer. 2. One of the panel's front corners was slightly lifted off two of the clips, as if the person who closed the panel (after installing the RAM) didn't finish the job properly. Made it easier for me to pop the panel though! 3. The first laptop I received had that RAM issue I mentioned. That would probably not pass QA at an HP manufacturing plant either. Standard procedure is to have a system booted at least three times.Am I happy with my assumption? No. But I'll deal with it after inspecting the RAM installed and comparing it with the first 8 GB stick. The laptop looks clean and I inspected Windows 11 as well for any \\\"weirdness\\\" or inappropriate programs.That said, would I purchase this again or recommend it. Only if a person's sole criteria for buying was price. Generally, I recommend buying laptops from the manufacturer directly.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 25}, {\"title\": \"1.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Do not buy from 'Chromebook Prosale'\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2025\", \"body\": \"Bought this laptop for school and it was absolutely perfect, for a few weeks until it crashed and gave an error code.

The 32 megs of ram and 1 tb hard drive make it run as well as it possibly can; it would be a slug if it had any less.  Overall, it's basic, as basic as you'd want.  I ended up buying MS Office and made it a decent setup.  If I were to buy it again, I'd choose a more powerful setup.  Remember, sometimes it's better to wait than get a subpar setup such as this one.  I'd suggest spending $100 more and finding a full Intel chip or AMD and forego the Intel Celeron at any cost.  I've been through this before but I forgot how sluggish the Celeron processors are. If you are limited, it's not a bad computer.  Be careful bc Amazon will show it's a $500 computer on sale.

They have responded in a timely manner and have been very accommodating in an effort to assuage my concerns about the computer and their warranty.With regards to the warranty, it should be noted that Oydisen WOWPC assumes responsibility for the 1-year warranty, which cannot be extended, and any attempt to register a computer purchased from a reseller on Amazon with the original manufacturer will likely result in a lot of confusion.With that knowledge in hand, you can be very confident that Oydisen WOWPC will stand behind their products.

When I say I got this from my daughter, I don\\u2019t mean to downplay it at all because I would get it for myself, although I have a high-performance laptop already, which I also got a phenomenal bargain on. This laptops processor is incredible as is the graphics card. These two together really offer a very high-end laptop. This is a brand new laptop and for the price of these products, I\\u2019m just blown away because if you do your research, you\\u2019ll see that this is easily about 25% below market value for all the specs in this laptop.

I might, at some point increase the ram up to 32 GB for her, but that is not necessary at all as 16 GB that it comes with is perfect.

While you can hear the fan, it's not nearly as loud or bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be. That being said, here are the reasons I'm not keeping this laptop. Individually, they are pretty small issues:1. There is no function lock button. So, if you want to use the F buttons, and then change it so that you can use the volume or brightness buttons, without holding down the Fn button, you can't simply switch between which one works w/out holding down the Fn button. You have to go into the bios and set it one way or another.2. No ability for facial login. What? In this day and age, it can't login or do passwords with the camera? Dumb.3. It's not nearly as fast and snappy as comparable laptops with the same specs. There's actually quite a bit of lag when you click to open or install a new program. I mean, a pretty good lag.4. Many laptops have the cooling air vents on the bottom. When are laptop makers going to realize this is a terrible place? I mean, you set it on your lap, and it blocks the airflow. I love my surface laptop, in which the vent is in the hinge between the monitor and the body.5. Only 1 USB-C port. Really?Anyway, not a bad price or terrible laptop, it just has too many little things that add up to a less than ideal user experience. Oh, and I really wish they would get rid of the standard power plugin to the laptop. It's the typical little round jack that you push into the laptop power port. Too many times over the years, I've had it pulled out accidentally, and it's super easy to ruin. I love the magnetic power attachment I have on my Surface laptop. If you trip over the cord or whatever, it just pulls off w/out damaging it.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    De las mejores laptop calidad precio\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2025\", \"body\": \"Siempre quise adquirir una laptop que me permitiera la mayor\\u00eda de videojuegos posibles a una buena calidad y con buen rendimiento.

I\\u2019ve owned this laptop for about 7 months, so let me give you my honest review on this product.This product has been with me since I turned 14, and I love it! It used to have amazing performance, easy to setup, and overall really high quality.However, with its positives, there are a couple negatives I would like to point out. First, it comes out of the box on balanced mode, meaning you will get steady FPS while keeping your fans quiet. But, after about 3 months, I noticed that the fans were starting to get way louder as I was using it. It kept my family up, and it was starting to become worse. I have tried Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant and Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and I can easily confirm that it is slower than when out of the box. Since I\\u2019ve owned it for 7 months, the health on the battery health started to get extremely worse. I am currently 7 months later seeing anywhere from 100-170 FPS in each of these games, which is not as good as it used to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I shared my experience with this. I hope you guys enjoy this laptop just as much as I did, but if you are looking at a higher budget, try looking into box-like gaming PCs. It is overall better on performance, and has lower latency, faster WiFi speeds, and is just overall better.Take care everyone \\ud83d\\udc4d\", \"helpfulVotes\": 10}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    \\u00a1Es mi primer laptop nuevo y la mejor que he comprado!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025\", \"body\": \"De verdad una compra excepcional, sin arrepentimiento lo que necesitaba para jugar y sobretodo m\\u00e1s para trabajar, el procesador es super rapido y 8 VRAM para cosas 3D, la \\u00fanica cosa es la bateria pero es una laptop gamer y con todo lo que tiene esta haciendo lo mejor para optimizar su uso.Hay un detalle que es solo una cosa por est\\u00e9tica que la laptop se ensucia mucho cuando la tocas, son cosas que bueno no se pueden evitar en el uso pero al final es genial esta laptop.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 2}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Good computer with small details\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2025\", \"body\": \"Good computer although it has been reset twice for no reason, and the screen goes black.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great School or Gaming Laptop!\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025\", \"body\": \"This is exactly the Gaming/Schooling Laptop I was looking for!

While you can hear the fan, it's not nearly as loud or bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be. That being said, here are the reasons I'm not keeping this laptop. Individually, they are pretty small issues:1. There is no function lock button. So, if you want to use the F buttons, and then change it so that you can use the volume or brightness buttons, without holding down the Fn button, you can't simply switch between which one works w/out holding down the Fn button. You have to go into the bios and set it one way or another.2. No ability for facial login. What? In this day and age, it can't login or do passwords with the camera? Dumb.3. It's not nearly as fast and snappy as comparable laptops with the same specs. There's actually quite a bit of lag when you click to open or install a new program. I mean, a pretty good lag.4. Many laptops have the cooling air vents on the bottom. When are laptop makers going to realize this is a terrible place? I mean, you set it on your lap, and it blocks the airflow. I love my surface laptop, in which the vent is in the hinge between the monitor and the body.5. Only 1 USB-C port. Really?Anyway, not a bad price or terrible laptop, it just has too many little things that add up to a less than ideal user experience. Oh, and I really wish they would get rid of the standard power plugin to the laptop. It's the typical little round jack that you push into the laptop power port. Too many times over the years, I've had it pulled out accidentally, and it's super easy to ruin. I love the magnetic power attachment I have on my Surface laptop.

It used to have amazing performance, easy to setup, and overall really high quality.However, with its positives, there are a couple negatives I would like to point out. First, it comes out of the box on balanced mode, meaning you will get steady FPS while keeping your fans quiet. But, after about 3 months, I noticed that the fans were starting to get way louder as I was using it. It kept my family up, and it was starting to become worse. I have tried Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant and Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and I can easily confirm that it is slower than when out of the box. Since I\\u2019ve owned it for 7 months, the health on the battery health started to get extremely worse. I am currently 7 months later seeing anywhere from 100-170 FPS in each of these games, which is not as good as it used to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I shared my experience with this. I hope you guys enjoy this laptop just as much as I did, but if you are looking at a higher budget, try looking into box-like gaming PCs. It is overall better on performance, and has lower latency, faster WiFi speeds, and is just overall better.Take care everyone \\ud83d\\udc4d\", \"helpfulVotes\": 10}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Annoying fan\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2025\", \"body\": \"Battery last 2-3hrs not plugged in.

After that, it gets boring rather quickly.  The keyboard is not impressive.  The backlit feature only comes in white.  Most Gaming laptops in this price range offer multiple choices of backlit keyboard (RGB).  The ports include three USB, One HDMI input, One USB C input, and a headphone jack.  Pretty standard.Claimed specs vs. actual specs:The speed of the CPU is listed as 2.4ghz.  That is somewhat disappointing considering most gaming laptops in this price range offer double that speed.  On average 4.7Ghz.  Gaming laptops require a lot of power and 2.4 GHz is just not sufficient anymore with today's games and graphics.  Next, I took a look at the refresh rate.  The refresh rate claims 144Hertz.  I have developed a trained eye over the years and upon initial view of this screen in various scenarios knew this was not a true 144Hertz refresh rate.  At best maybe 120 Hertz, but certainly not 144htz.  Not a deal breaker but I was looking forward to the faster refresh rate.Lastly, I compared this to other gaming systems in the same price range and they simply outperformed this unit in almost every aspect except battery life!  I attribute the better battery life to the fact that it has less power than the other units.This is a basic beginner's gaming system at best.

One of the most glaring issues is its processors, which, while advertised as being capable of handling gaming and intensive tasks, are far from adequate in delivering a smooth, enjoyable experience. Many users report frequent stuttering, lag, and overheating during gaming sessions, all of which stem from poor CPU performance. Whether it's an Intel or AMD variant, the Nitro 5's processors are often underpowered for the games and applications it's supposed to support. This means that even mid-tier games can feel choppy, forcing users to turn down settings just to avoid thermal throttling, which is caused by the machine\\u2019s inability to manage heat properly.In addition to weak processors, the overall build quality of the Acer Nitro 5 is equally disheartening. The laptop feels cheap and plasticky, with creaky hinges and a chassis that flexes under the slightest pressure. This lack of durability makes the laptop feel like it's ready to break at any moment, especially when carried around or used on the go. This low-quality construction is far from what anyone should expect in a laptop, let alone one marketed as a gaming machine. The keyboard and trackpad, essential components for any user, feel flimsy and unresponsive, adding to the frustration when trying to use the device for extended periods. It's clear that Acer cut corners when designing the Nitro 5, favoring flashy RGB lights and aggressive marketing over a well-built, reliable device.One of the most critical issues with the Nitro 5 is its abysmal ventilation system. The laptop's cooling solution is so inadequate that it feels like a joke to anyone who tries to run anything remotely intensive. The fans are loud, constantly spinning up to their maximum RPMs, and yet, they fail to keep the internal components cool. The laptop heats up significantly during gaming sessions or any heavy workload, and the heat is not properly dissipated, leading to uncomfortable use and thermal throttling. Acer even goes as far as to recommend that users elevate the laptop at least 6 inches off the surface to achieve \\\"proper ventilation.\\\" This is a ridiculous requirement for a supposedly portable device, and it underlines just how poor the laptop's design really is. Instead of investing in a better cooling system, Acer expects users to buy external cooling pads or stands just to keep their laptop functioning at a basic level.Battery life is another major downfall of the Acer Nitro 5. Despite being marketed as a gaming laptop, the battery life is nothing short of abysmal. Many users report that the laptop barely lasts more than two hours on a full charge when performing basic tasks like browsing the web or watching videos. When gaming or doing anything demanding, that time plummets even further, making it impossible to use the laptop away from an outlet for any significant period. This lack of battery performance makes the Nitro 5 a terrible choice for anyone who needs a laptop that can function for long periods without being tethered to a power source. It might as well be a desktop with how reliant it is on constant charging, which completely defeats the purpose of having a portable device.The Nitro 5 also suffers from a frustrating lack of connectivity options, especially when it comes to USB ports. For a gaming laptop, users expect plenty of options to plug in peripherals like external hard drives, mice, keyboards, and gaming controllers. Unfortunately, the Nitro 5 is sorely lacking in this department. It only offers a handful of USB ports, which is nowhere near enough for the average gamer or professional who needs to connect multiple devices simultaneously. This limitation forces users to either invest in a USB hub or constantly swap devices, which is both inconvenient and unnecessary on a modern laptop. For a device meant to handle a wide range of tasks, this is another glaring oversight that adds to the long list of reasons why the Acer Nitro 5 falls short of expectations.The weight of the Nitro 5 also makes it impractical as a portable device. Weighing in at nearly 5.5 pounds, this laptop feels more like a brick than a sleek, portable machine. Its bulky design and heavy weight make it a chore to carry around, especially for anyone who needs to travel with their laptop frequently. Whether you\\u2019re commuting, going to class, or even just moving it around the house, the Nitro 5\\u2019s heft makes it clear that it's better suited as a desktop replacement rather than a true laptop. The idea of portability is completely lost when you consider how heavy and awkward the Nitro 5 is to move, making it more of a stationary device that you\\u2019ll want to keep on your desk at all times.Compounding these issues is the fact that, even when set up properly as a desktop replacement, the Nitro 5\\u2019s performance is underwhelming. Despite its heavy weight, loud fans, and elevated placement for \\\"proper ventilation,\\\" the device still struggles with heat management and performance under load. It\\u2019s ironic that, despite all the sacrifices in portability, the Nitro 5 still fails to deliver on the one thing it\\u2019s supposed to do: provide a solid gaming and multitasking experience. Even when plugged in and stationary, the laptop cannot escape its poor design choices, further emphasizing that it\\u2019s simply not worth the investment. This makes the Nitro 5 a terrible choice for those looking for a gaming laptop that can perform well both on the go and at home.To summarize, the Acer Nitro 5 is a deeply flawed laptop that fails to live up to the expectations set by its marketing. Its processors are underpowered, leading to a poor user experience in both gaming and productivity tasks. The build quality is low, with flimsy materials and a cheap feel that detracts from the overall usability of the device. The ventilation is so bad that users are forced to elevate the laptop off the surface just to prevent it from overheating, and the battery life is laughably short. The lack of sufficient USB ports makes it difficult to use with the peripherals most users would need, and the heavy weight makes it more suitable as a desktop than a true portable laptop. For anyone considering the Acer Nitro 5, it's clear that there are far better options available that won't leave you frustrated with the numerous compromises this machine demands.PS. this was written on an acer nitro 5.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 5}, {\"title\": \"Si son de M\\u00e9xico u otro pa\\u00eds, no la compren.\", \"rating\": null, \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on February 25, 2025\", \"body\": \"Si la piensan adquirir y est\\u00e1s en M\\u00e9xico u otro pa\\u00eds, olvidate de tu garant\\u00eda no te van a dar soluci\\u00f3n ni en Amazon ni en Acer.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"Cr\", \"rating\": null, \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on February 14, 2025\", \"body\": \"Crashea a cada rato\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"No confien en lo que les venden.\", \"rating\": null, \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on July 27, 2024\", \"body\": \"En la descripcion decia que venia con el teclado en Espa\\u00f1ol, viene en la version ingles.El MousePad tiene un GRAN problema, funciona y de arratos no funciona o hace doble click al deslizar el dedo.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"Se tapa el ventilador\", \"rating\": null, \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on September 16, 2024\", \"body\": \"Esta wena, pero no la compren jakajsj la pantalla tapa el ventilador y se calientan las dos cosas, a la larga va a da\\u00f1ar la pantalla y todo :'(\", \"helpfulVotes\": 0}, {\"title\": \"La peor compra de mi vida\", \"rating\": null, \"date\": \"Reviewed in Mexico on August 10, 2024\", \"body\": \"Compr\\u00e9 la laptop hace 2 meses, la laptop vino defectuosa de f\\u00e1brica, su pantalla no prend\\u00eda as\\u00ed que la devolv\\u00ed,  hace mes y medio, pero no han querido regresar mi dinero.

And extended warranty company Asurion.Amazon's  practice of listing and selling products like Dell computers for third party sellers seems like a scam, since the third party seller can sell old products on Amazon where the warranty is already expired or almost so.  And I saw nothing on AMAZON's site when I bought the DELL computer that things like an expired or limited time warranty could be an issue when buying ON AMAZON from a third party seller.Bought this Dell computer on Amazon, July 16, 2024, and Jan.3, 2025 the screen separated from the cover.  Contacted Dell, and they advised the WARRANTY was EXPIRED!  That's less than 6 months.  Dell said the AMAZON third party seller resold the computer on AMAZON months after it bought the computer, and the warranty began to run earlier when the third party seller bought the computer. Not when I purchased the computer on Amazon!Spent hours on the phone with Dell, and they know about this issue with third party sellers.  Even after providing them with the Amazon invoice and receipt of when I took possession of the computer, they would not help me and apply and run the warranty to the date I bought the computer from Amazon.Amazon's rep basically said sorry, but that's my problem for buying from a third party seller. Say what?  I bought the computer on AMAZON and paid AMAZON.  Now I'm out of luck?To make matters worse, I bought an extended warranty on Amazon from Asurion on the same day I bought the Dell computer on Amazon.  When I tried to make a claim, Asurion auto responded that the Dell computer still has the manufactures warranty and to contact Dell, seemingly as a result of only having purchased the computer from Amazon in July.  And not taking into account that the warranty started to run when the third party seller bought the computer months earlier.Shame on Dell, Amazon, and Asurion.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 115}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2025\", \"body\": \"A great price for a 40 GB Ram and 2 TB memory.

I like the backlit keyboard.As for what I do not like:*as a touch typist it is \\\"hard\\\" to find home because \\\"gh\\\" is not center line of laptop but offset a several inches left.  It is such a big un-natural shift  I ended up adding a 1/8\\\" strip of black tape under the space bar above the touch pad for my thumbs to have a tactile reference as well.* the USB-C port does not support laptop charging. For the price paid, the laptop should have this as it would have eliminated a cord entering the laptop.

I opted for the 64GB memory and 2TB SSD upgrades. You cannot get these specs from HP (they only offer >16GB memory and 1TB SSD versions on my model). Therefore HP will alert that they have no record of the serial number and product number for the warranty. Why? Because that much memory and SSD isn't something they offer, ao it doesnt tally in their system. This is why the seller warranties the laptop for a year, because of the upgrades they've done. So please, know that you're getting an upgraded laptop from an 'upgrader' vs a standard (lower spec) one direct from HP. I reached out to the seller with questions in order to understand and learn this. But the laptop I received was exactly what they said it would be. It's just HP can't warranty it BECAUSE of the upgrades done by someone else (that HP doesn't offer).Laptop seems great though, with all the standard bloatware that HP puts on there I had to remove.

I made this HP Laptop purchase after extensive research and comparison. I have a Dell Inspiron and was very pleased with it's performance. However, the outdated 7200 rpm hard drive over heated too many times and finally crashed.  I was able to clone most of the data to a new SSD drive; and upgraded the RAM to 16 GBs and the Dell kept marching along. Now, I find the Dell to lag, slows down when using multiple programs, and freezes at the most inopportune times (I use it for djing). So, I decided to purchase a new computer during the holiday \\\"savings\\\" period.  Again, after a lot of research, reviewing, waiting, comparing, and hoping, I finally purchased this HP laptop. It boasted a \\\"high octane\\\" bundle of components that would make computing \\\"fast and furious\\\". I have not witnessed that yet.  I find the WIndows 11 platform to be non-user friendly, non-ergodynamic, and error ridden. The HP seems to constantly search for something before loading web browsers, programs, and commands. This is frustrating because the HP has the 12th gen i7 chip, 32 GB of RAM and a host of other high speed components that don't seem to be working in sync with each others.  Is this HP a great value?  The short answer is Yes! However, buyer beware that cheap prices often come with a cheap build with discount internal hardware components that take longer to work with each other causing frustration and anxiety. Next time, I think I will buy directly from manufacturer and ensure they use proprietary components that are compatible.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 5}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Battery\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024\", \"body\": \"Batter discharges quickly.

I made this HP Laptop purchase after extensive research and comparison. I have a Dell Inspiron and was very pleased with it's performance. However, the outdated 7200 rpm hard drive over heated too many times and finally crashed.  I was able to clone most of the data to a new SSD drive; and upgraded the RAM to 16 GBs and the Dell kept marching along. Now, I find the Dell to lag, slows down when using multiple programs, and freezes at the most inopportune times (I use it for djing). So, I decided to purchase a new computer during the holiday \\\"savings\\\" period.  Again, after a lot of research, reviewing, waiting, comparing, and hoping, I finally purchased this HP laptop. It boasted a \\\"high octane\\\" bundle of components that would make computing \\\"fast and furious\\\". I have not witnessed that yet.  I find the WIndows 11 platform to be non-user friendly, non-ergodynamic, and error ridden. The HP seems to constantly search for something before loading web browsers, programs, and commands. This is frustrating because the HP has the 12th gen i7 chip, 32 GB of RAM and a host of other high speed components that don't seem to be working in sync with each others.  Is this HP a great value?  The short answer is Yes! However, buyer beware that cheap prices often come with a cheap build with discount internal hardware components that take longer to work with each other causing frustration and anxiety. Next time, I think I will buy directly from manufacturer and ensure they use proprietary components that are compatible.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 5}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Temperatura\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2025\", \"body\": \"Se recalienta muy rapidamente\", \"helpfulVotes\": 2}, {\"title\": \"2.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Worked for a few hours\", \"rating\": 2, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2024\", \"body\": \"Was very happy with how the laptop felt and performed right away.

I ended going on youtube  and followed the instructions which worked .I finally received an email from Asus instructing me to do the same instructions o youtube.  The problem started again disconnecting itself from power. I requested help again. Never heard back. The only emails I received pertained to sales to buy another.

It runs YouTube videos at 1080p or 1440p perfectly smooth.  It can have an infrequent stutter if you try to run the video at 4K, however the screen is only capable of displaying 1080p.  If it's a slower motion video, you might notice a bit smoother motion than at 1080p but it's tough to pick out if you don't know what to look for.  Otherwise, it functions just as well as the previous 4 different models of Chromebook I've owned (Lenovo, Asus, 2 Acers).  There are 2 things that caused me to not rate it 5 stars:  1) No HDMI out capability.  I wasn't aware that anyone still made a laptop/Chromebook model in 2024 that does not have an HDMI port or capability to output HDMI video thru a USB-C port.  If you don't need HDMI/video out then this shouldn't be an issue.  2) Occasionally, if it sits with the lid open long enough, the sound output stops whether or not you have headphones plugged in.  The only way I've found to re-enable sound is to reboot it (reload button + power button).  Not a big deal since Chrome will ask if you want to re-open up all your tabs and apps.

I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a \\\"bling\\\" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad.

I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great.

Summary (1) run tmutils listlocalsnapshots from Terminal with output redirected to a text file, (2) edit that file to have sudo tmutils deletelocalsnapshots <date of snapshot> on each line and save the file, (3) use the source command to run the commands in the file.This purges space that's not otherwise available and frees enough \\\"disk\\\" to do the upgrade.I then used Open Core Legacy Patcher 2.2.0 (OCLP) (free but contributions appreciated) to add the drivers for video and - critically Wi-Fi networking.My system offered the upgrade directly from Apple but I think that's because of an earlier attempt to use OLCP that was thwarted by lack of disk space enabled the upgrade once there was enough disk space.Sequoia was running after the upgrade but without working Wi-Fi and hence no network connection. I was able to find a USB ethernet adapter and get the system onto the network. Then I was able to download OCLP and run it to patch the operating system to work better.After a reboot, the video and Wi-Fi were working. I was able to add remote control both with TeamViewer Corporate and the free Chrome Remote Desktop (CRD).The attached photo is a screenshot from my main Windows 11 Pro system using CRD to access the MacBook Air and showing the \\\"About This Mac\\\" dialog.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 12}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Very Good laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2025\", \"body\": \"Great laptop, wasn't sure if i would regret this purchase but i'm very happy with the speed and performance.

It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.

Four months of troubleshooting, uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. And, to add insult to injury, HP support is horrible. They offer 24/7 support. Not So!!!!!  What they offer is untrained personnel who will say, \\\"this is beyond my scope, However we offer a service....\\\"  and, for that one has to pay .  Thus, the 24/7 warranty for one year, really does not exist.  This is not the customer suport I had for years in the past. I will never bu another HP again. Completely disillusioned with this even with the help  of computer tech, the microphone only works at 1%.  The windows 11  problems are more  complicated and if one goes to the MS support there are so many with the ame issues which remain unresolved.  The problems are more than I am able toi identify.  At this point, I am disgusted with both  HP and Windows 11.  Not a good computer deal.January 2025 :Update:  Computer is lovely but Windows 11 is not at all nice to work with.  It is  simply not nice!  It corruputs settings of printer, of wifi, of speakers etc.  If they worked with the comuter after a few weeks, they no longer work or worked. It is a constant challenge.  Sadly there isno option to Windows 11 as Windows 10 will cease to have suport in  October. 2025.I have had many computer and windows 7, 8, 9, 10 but 11 is awful.  I have never had such difficulty with  windows settings previously.Original review:Love the computer.  I have had HP computers and printers for the majority of my iife with computers and printers both for home and office.  I find  I  always return to them.  (I had one Dell but returned to HP  products.)I note that I have had connectivity issues which surprises me. This has never happened prviously  with my last laptop  at home in the US or while traveling internationally.  I am not sure why but the apps on the computer do not seem to hold my printer  stettings and at times other settings (wifi.)  That having been noted,  I am still happy with the computer.

Nothing fantastic, everything is fairly basic, but it is decent for the price. The core memory and storage capacity (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) are perfect midrange specs, and will be exactly what the majority of PC users need. Certainly isn't a gaming laptop, but that is clearly not the market it is aimed at.  Works well for upgrading older, less tech savvy individuals to Windows 11, with the larger screen and decent basic specs.Only Major complaint is HP's AWFUL keyboard layout. Moving the power button to the keyboard is one of the dumbest decisions I have ever seen. I've bought HP laptops for multiple people in recent years, every time there was major confusion over the power button, and I have received repeated complaints about the power button from every person who uses it.The power button is hard to find when first opening the computer, and easy to press by accident during normal use. For some reason they decided to place it in the center of the top row, right next to the delete and backspace keys, some of the most commonly used keys, making it very easy to press while typing. Just putting it in the far right hand corner of the keyboard would be a major improvement. It basically forces you to disable the power button in the windows settings, which makes turning the thing off more awkward. The arrow keys are also bad, (particularly for people that regularly use them in excel, apparently), they are half height and awkward to use, with it being easy to press the wrong direction, or both simultaneously.Bloatware is at a relative minimum, still contains some useless junk but I didn't see anything particularly bad, like borderline adware or trial antivirus software, and there wasn't anything resource intensive running at startup.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 31}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Solid laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024\", \"body\": \"I have been wanting a laptop to take on trips in order to RDP to my servers using Citrix Workspace and this fits the bill especially with the large 17.3 inch screen. My work laptop is a 15 inch, and the 2 extra inches is nice. This is also lighter than my work laptop. For the past four days I used this for work, I sat at a desk for half the time and couch or bed the other half. At no time while on the couch or bed did I feel it got too hot for my legs. The battery was averaging 6 hrs of constant use. The sound was decent for a laptop. I won\\u2019t go over specs as they are already available.It took around 40 minutes to get logged in and completely setup and I added Chrome, Office XP, Teams, Citrix and used my PC onedrive image of my desktop. Once all logged in, I shut off the PC and did 3 boot up tests, booting in 23 seconds. I then did dl/ul tests connecting to Ookla, I have TMobile home internet, scored 683 dl/57 ul wirelessly connected. For reference, my PC has never gotten above 540/50. I installed Filmora to edit a few drone videos, I don\\u2019t do heavy editing, but this laptop handled exporting my edited videos in maybe 2 minutes slower than my 7950x3d.I do not plan on using this for any gaming, but for giggles I tried it. I installed WorldOfTanks and played 5 games. I ran 3 games full screen and two windowed. I ran at \\u201clow\\u201d graphics\\u201d I believe minimal is one step lower. I was averaging 65-70 fps (pic) and pinging 75ms (normal ping for me). As you can see in the AMD performance pic, I was maxing the GPU, but the CPU was running 10-15% and memory was running around 50%. I was impressed. The game ran smoothly at that with no frame drops, I did have a couple latency hiccups but that is normal for my PC as well. After my game session I tested for heat temps. The left middle was the hottest @ 95F which is very reasonable. I included several pics to show my findings.Overall, I think it\\u2019s a solid laptop that is perfect for work/casual usage and can be used for non-demanding games.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 25}, {\"title\": \"4.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Great midrange large screened laptop\", \"rating\": 4, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024\", \"body\": \"This is a excellent midrange laptop with a 17 inch 1920X1080 16:9 screen that makes viewing items so much easier than the smaller displays.

Details follow...This laptop comes with a single-page somewhat generic instruction sheet and an AC adapter. It is the absolute bare minimum documentation, but it is enough to get you started. After charging the laptop, you need an internet connection and about half an hour to complete the initial configuration of Windows. Once the basic Windows 11 system was configured, I tried asking the AI-enhanced Microsoft Edge browser how to install and configure some additional open-source software and it kept giving me directions for how to do those things with Windows 10 -- directions that mostly don't work on Windows 11. Fortunately, ordinary internet searches found valid answers...The AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor is relatively fast, with four cores (eight threads) normally running at 2795MHz. 16GB RAM is enough for most business and/or programming uses. The 512GB SSD is fast and big enough for most purposes although it's easy to fill if you work with a lot of high-resolution images and/or video -- it is best to think of the SSD as workspace for images and videos you will archive elsewhere when done editing. The built-in Radeon GPU handles business graphics and image and video editing nicely, and is OK for accelerating some AI processing, but it isn't up to running high-end 3D games at full resolution.The screen itself is huge, with a diagonal of 17.3\\\" for the active area. Initially, I was a bit concerned that the 1920x1080 resolution might look a little coarse because I'm used to a laptop with a 4K 16.5\\\" display. However, this laptop's display has a nice matte finish, which avoids the reflections seen with my older laptop's 4K screen, is visible from wide viewing angles (see photo), and the resolution difference isn't obvious from a normal viewing distance. This display is particularly well-suited for giving presentations to small groups or watching videos. When I'm coding or writing research papers, I like to have two full pages of text side-by-side on the display, and that also works fine for this laptop. I had no problems while using my Ubuntu Linux-based software development environment on this laptop under Windows WSL (note that Ubuntu for WSL is a free install available from Microsoft's App Store).The keyboard is slightly recessed but has a good feel. The touchpad is also large and works well. I had no problems with the WiFi or other interfaces. The built-in webcam works fine with Zoom and just about any webcam software (it supports the driverless UVC protocol), but the image quality is a little disappointing, especially in poor lighting. On the other hand, I have to complement HP on the very well-thought-out sliding privacy cover integrated into the webcam.Physically, despite the huge display, this unit is quite thin and weighs a little under 4.5 pounds -- a weight you'd expect to reach only with a smaller screen. The metal case looks nice and doesn't feel flimsy, but I'd be a bit concerned that it could easily get scratched, so you might want to put it in a laptop sleeve before throwing it in your backpack. The included AC adapter is also small enough to carry easily, although you'll want to carry it on trips because it uses a power plug like older HP laptops rather than a generic USB C charger input. Battery life seems very good, as you'd expect for a TDP 15W processor, although it's hard to quote a typical runtime because there are so many power management options. Incidentally, the power button is the function key sixth from the right on the keyboard -- I had to read their one-page instruction sheet to find the power button.  ;-)In sum, I highly recommend this laptop for business and/or programming use. The desktop computers I use all have 4K 43\\\" displays, so I'm used to the benefits of seeing lots of stuff on the display all at once; this 17.3\\\" display comes much closer to that experience than most laptops without sacrificing portability, performance, or battery life. The main downsides are the relatively weak GPU and the fact that none of the hardware is trivially upgradeable.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 13}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Good quality Laptop\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024\", \"body\": \"I ordered the HP 17.3\\\" laptop for home office use, and I am extremely happy the overall performance.  This laptop is user friendly, has plenty of power, ample storage, and has excellent graphics.These are my favorite features of this laptop:- The computer boots right up and has no issues with latency.  While I wouldn't go as far as classifying this as a gaming computer, it does perform well when it comes to Teams calls, watching Netflix, browsing on the internet, and everything in between.- The speakers are crystal clear and the camera produces high quality video.  I'm on a lot of Teams calls throughout the day, and I am very pleased with the overall performance of the audio and video.  It's also nice that the camera has a built in shutter to ensure privacy while not on a call.  The shutter has a white screen when it is closed, making it easy to identify when the shutter is open or closed.- I really appreciate the size of the keyboard and the screen.  That has always been one of the pitfalls of using a laptop for me.  I don't like working on smaller screens, especially since I am used to having two screens on my desktop computer.  The larger screen makes it so much easier to multi-task and work with spreadsheets.  Same goes for the keyboard.

I love the AMD Ryzen series and have installed one of their CPUs in the last half dozen or so computers I've built.  The AMD Radeon graphics is pretty good for an integrated solution but just can't deliver the goods like a discrete GPU.  Then again, you could add a good chunk of change to the price of this laptop were you to add a GPU.I don't really like the trend toward LPDDR5 RAM.  I understand the upside it has in a laptop but don't like the way it precludes upgrading.  That said, 16 GB and a 512 SSD drive is enough for general use.  The webcam is fine--particularly for a consumer audience.  It's really offers solid specs and performance at the price point.Kudos to HP for not going overboard with bloatware and other useless apps.  On the other hand, the experience of installing and using Windows is as miserable as ever.  One of the great things about Ubuntu (the OS of choice on my laptop and desktop) is that it doesn't try to sell me something every time I turn on my PC.  Making the Windows 11 experience even worse is the difficulty in configuring the UI.  The first thing I did was try and remove the news feed and other useless feeds.  It took several attempts and three restarts.  The fact that MSFT makes it so hard to configure my own operating system is absurd.  It's even more absurd that Windows makes it so difficult for a large audience of general consumer users.  If a 'power user' with plenty of tech knowledge such as myself has to jump through endless hoops just to make the OS look and act the way I want to I can only imagine how 'average users' feel.All of the bloatware and other nonsense that comes with Windows 11 is a shame since the OS itself is IMO the best they've released since WinXP.  If you're fairly tech savvy there's ways to significantly reduce or eliminate the bloatware, the burdensome resource overhead and the endless sales pitches but they definitely don't make it easy for the end user.Ultimately, however, the hardware isn't the OS--even if the OS drives the user experience.  Generally, when I review a computer I can immediately name a good 'target market' that should consider it.  This one isn't so easy.  Most average users don't need a 17\\\" screen anymore.  With smaller bezels and better display quality you can get the same visual experience with a 16\\\" or smaller device. I've seen 14\\\" devices with more actual screen space than the 15\\\" laptops of just a few years ago.  A secondary problem with such a big screen is that it makes the laptop bulky.  The weight isn't so much the problem as the heft due to the overall size.  My primary laptop is a 15\\\" but I also have a 16\\\" device that I use for some content creation tasks.  I was amazed at how much bulkier the 17\\\" laptop feels even though given the comparable size it probably shouldn't.One market segment that can benefit from a larger screen is gaming enthusiasts but the lack of a discrete GPU and lack of RAM upgrade possibilities doesn't lend itself to this demographic.  It might be a decent desktop replacement for office use, assuming mostly basic tasks.  For example, my mom is a real estate agent and the overwhelming majority of her computer work is emails, research, taking notes, etc.  These specs would be great for her as would the bigger screen.  She doesn't need to drive around all day carrying her laptop and it spends 90+ percent of the time on her desk.  That makes the overall heft of the HP laptop a non-issue.Of course, my inability to come up with good 'target markets' for this laptop doesn't really matter.  If you like the larger screen (with the corresponding larger form factor) and don't need any heavy duty speed or processing power this is a great choice--particularly at the price point.  The price point also makes it a good choice for a teenager who just wants to watch videos and email, or a parent/relative that would benefit from a larger screen and doesn't need 'bleeding edge' tech capability, etc.  Overall, a great price for impressive specs in a very servicable laptop.

The ram isn't the problem as the 7520u processor was upgraded to support DDR5... however, the 7520u processor is... also mediocre, wherein the processor is a Zen 2 processor with only 4 cores and 8 threads (8 threads total as each core hosts two threads.) The Zen 2 is a functional processor node though, but it is a old one. Think back on the Ryzen 3000 series processors. There is a light though, though dim, and that is the RDNA 2 gpu. It is a onboard 610M gpu, which is standard in the 7000 lineup that are not G series processors. It has 128 stream processors (Unified Shader Cores, think CUDA from NVidia) This is not a lot of gpu power though as a G series processor could have up to 768 stream processors. What is weird is that they added 2 ray tracing cores onto this GPU which confuses me as I see nothing that would work well with and likely this is ripped from a larger GPU cluster and made into a module.This is great though for video, web based games, and things like accounting or other work requiring numbers or typing. There is a number pad and another mediocre part, the keyboard. There is a lot of flex in the keyboard, especially in the middle. I opened it up to find minimal bracing and the motherboard directly below the keyboard so no hulk smash of the keyboard less you want a broken one.Interesting notes though, there isn't much for upgrades here. You can upgrade the network card and the NVME SSD drive. Repairability is higher though, with separate daughter board for the Left I/O ports (usb, audio) as well as the power port not being on the motherboard, making the proprietary cord for power a bit easier to repair in the future if or when it breaks. Though I do wish that they allowed for charging through the USB port... that was a letdown to find it does not charge through the USB-C port, which means I can not use my dock to charge it. (Also means they did not make use of USBC 4 which is not native to the Processor, which only support 3.2 gen 1.)Opening it up though did reveal a good system for removing heat, allowing that there is proper clearance under the unit. I was happy with the cooling solution though, and even think it was more than actually required. The motherboard used quality parts, and I love that they are repurposing a battery for a more universal fit situation. This decreases cost for HP and increases options for repair in the future. The SSD was a samsung unit, looked like it was a all in one controller with a side DDR memory module. (either that or the module was the controller and it was DDRless) But I trust Samsung as a part and think this is a good one to have. (All in one controller for NVME means that both the NVME processor and memory are found on one unit, first instance I found of this was small NVME units from Kioxia, formerly known as Toshiba.) Inside the HP there wasn't anything I was really disappointed at though with one exception.The exception was the screen hinges. The hinge system reminded me of HP engineering of the late 2000's. Think 2008-2010. HP was one of the worst companies at that point as a tech that had to repair them, but by 2011 I was seeing more and more options that were great. Getting back to the hinges, there may not be a problem if they tuned the tension correctly. However, they are using the same setup of metal inside plastic housing and I have seen so many times how that fails requiring replacement of part of the laptops body and sometimes even the screen or wire harness. There is no additional bracing to prevent flex in the area as well, though the bottom is deep and works well.Another thing, repairing this will require that you remove the bottom feet to access five hidden screws. Once out, and tight line on the upper section of the body attaches the bottom to the top of the body assembly via clips. Guitar picks and plastic pry tools will be required to gently coax the two halves apart. The good news is, you only have to open this unit up for repairs only, and likely well past the warranty. There is no major reason to be accessing the inside when so little inside is capable of upgrades or replacement.The screen on this 17 inch laptop is actually the best part of this unit. Things like keyboard flex and unmentioned till now key mushiness are likely the worst things for this laptop. Other things like underwhelming processor are more of a AMD thing, though is a great entry to a new laptop. When I first got this, they were talking about $750 for the price and that is not worth it, now it is $599 as of writing this while not being on sale and that is a better price though I was thinking $550 when I was looking at it part wise so I was close. Only thing I would be considering as a worry point is those screen hinges though. I would love to see some sort of structural brace inside these in the future though where that would help with the keyboard flex.Little bonus, this unit does have a built in Camera shutter so you can manually close the camera off. Sound on this isn't stellar, but it is good overall for what it is. I can recommend it at 599, but with the caveat of watching the pressure you put on the screen when opening it. If you do want better than this laptop, you will be looking at either smaller ones, older models, or larger cost units.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 23}, {\"title\": \"5.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Excellent\", \"rating\": 5, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2024\", \"body\": \"Really like this laptop and for the price it\\u2019s amazing.

Four months of troubleshooting, uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. And, to add insult to injury, HP support is horrible. They offer 24/7 support. Not So!!!!!  What they offer is untrained personnel who will say, \\\"this is beyond my scope, However we offer a service....\\\"  and, for that one has to pay .  Thus, the 24/7 warranty for one year, really does not exist.  This is not the customer suport I had for years in the past. I will never bu another HP again. Completely disillusioned with this even with the help  of computer tech, the microphone only works at 1%.  The windows 11  problems are more  complicated and if one goes to the MS support there are so many with the ame issues which remain unresolved.  The problems are more than I am able toi identify.  At this point, I am disgusted with both  HP and Windows 11.  Not a good computer deal.January 2025 :Update:  Computer is lovely but Windows 11 is not at all nice to work with.  It is  simply not nice!  It corruputs settings of printer, of wifi, of speakers etc.  If they worked with the comuter after a few weeks, they no longer work or worked. It is a constant challenge.  Sadly there isno option to Windows 11 as Windows 10 will cease to have suport in  October. 2025.I have had many computer and windows 7, 8, 9, 10 but 11 is awful.  I have never had such difficulty with  windows settings previously.Original review:Love the computer.  I have had HP computers and printers for the majority of my iife with computers and printers both for home and office.  I find  I  always return to them.  (I had one Dell but returned to HP  products.)I note that I have had connectivity issues which surprises me. This has never happened prviously  with my last laptop  at home in the US or while traveling internationally.  I am not sure why but the apps on the computer do not seem to hold my printer  stettings and at times other settings (wifi.)  That having been noted,  I am still happy with the computer.  It is fast,  The keyboard is easier to use than on my last HP Laptop .  For home an business purposes, this was a great deal.\", \"helpfulVotes\": 9}, {\"title\": \"3.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    keyboard is horrible, letters are etched/not smooth, messing up touch typing\", \"rating\": 3, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024\", \"body\": \"works ok, but keyboard is horrible, every key has texture messing up finding home keys\", \"helpfulVotes\": 3}, {\"title\": \"1.0 out of 5 stars\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    Terrible laptop\", \"rating\": 1, \"date\": \"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2024\", \"body\": \"I have only ever used hp.
