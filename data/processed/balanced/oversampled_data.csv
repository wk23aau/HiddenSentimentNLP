    HP 14 Laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2025","HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) – Affordable and Portable, but with Some Trade-offs⭐ Rating: 4.0/5 ⭐Pros:✅ Affordable Price – This HP 14 laptop is budget-friendly, making it a great option for students, light users, or those in need of a secondary device.✅ Portable & Lightweight – The thin and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, ideal for on-the-go use.✅ Decent Display – The 14-inch HD micro-edge display offers clear visuals, though it's not full HD.✅ Windows 11 Home – Comes with the latest OS, which is optimized for modern applications.✅ 1-Year Microsoft 365 Subscription – A great addition for users who rely on Word, Excel, and other Office tools.Cons:❌ Limited Performance – The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is okay for basic tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, but struggles with multitasking or demanding applications.❌ Only 4GB RAM – The memory is quite low for modern standards, leading to slower performance when multiple tabs or applications are open.❌ Minimal Storage (64GB eMMC) – The storage space is extremely limited, meaning you'll need external storage or cloud solutions for larger files.❌ Not Ideal for Heavy Use – Not recommended for gaming, video editing, or other intensive tasks.❌ No Backlit Keyboard – Typing in low-light conditions can be challenging.Final Verdict:The HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) is a solid choice for those needing an affordable, portable device for light tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick—but if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage.",66,all,"HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) – Affordable and Portable, but with Some Trade-offs⭐ Rating: 4.0/5 ⭐Pros:✅ Affordable Price – This HP 14 laptop is budget-friendly, making it a great option for students, light users, or those in need of a secondary device.✅ Portable & Lightweight – The thin and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, ideal for on-the-go use.✅ Decent Display – The 14-inch HD micro-edge display offers clear visuals, though it's not full HD.✅ Windows 11 Home – Comes with the latest OS, which is optimized for modern applications.✅ 1-Year Microsoft 365 Subscription – A great addition for users who rely on Word, Excel, and other Office tools.Cons:❌ Limited Performance – The Intel Celeron N4020 processor is okay for basic tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, but struggles with multitasking or demanding applications.❌ Only 4GB RAM – The memory is quite low for modern standards, leading to slower performance when multiple tabs or applications are open.❌ Minimal Storage (64GB eMMC) – The storage space is extremely limited, meaning you'll need external storage or cloud solutions for larger files.❌ Not Ideal for Heavy Use – Not recommended for gaming, video editing, or other intensive tasks.❌ No Backlit Keyboard – Typing in low-light conditions can be challenging.Final Verdict:The HP 14 Laptop (14-dq0040nr) is a solid choice for those needing an affordable, portable device for light tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work.

    Very Good For Limited Use",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2025","I got this laptop for use while traveling. Will not use it for demanding software. It's slow. but in the acceptable range. It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode. S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price.",16,all,"I got this laptop for use while traveling.

    You get your moneys worth",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024","It’s a computer for $100 give or take. You really can expect only so much out of it. It does the trick. Only issue to me its that it’s a pain in the butt do download google chrome on it, which, I wouldn’t care about using necessarily however apparently a lot of programs online only work with chrome.

    HP 14 Laptop: Great for a notebook under $200, But Keep RAM Limitations in Mind",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024","The HP 14 is a great choice for those looking for a basic laptop under $200, but it’s not for gamers, designers, or anyone who does more than the basics on their computer. Most surprisingly, it’s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that’s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam’s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn’t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities.I don’t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I’ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**",89,all,"The HP 14 is a great choice for those looking for a basic laptop under $200, but it’s not for gamers, designers, or anyone who does more than the basics on their computer.

    Believe the hype",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2025","This is now my second Macbook I've owned. My first was the touchbar 2017 Macbook Pro, and that pales in comparison to this. As I've grown older, I have less of a need to use the processing power from the Pro models, and just need something light to carry around and do 90% of my work. This laptop is that, and so much more.I've been using this laptop very frequently for a little over two months now, and I'm in love with pretty much everything about it. I'm amazed at how light it is, while still feeling so, so premium. The metal curves around the screen and body feel so high quality when you graze your finger across them. One of the major gripes I had about my last Macbook was the keyboard -- the touchbar model keyboard was awful. The keys had a habit of failing occasionally. The new Macbook keyboards? Actually a keyboard now. Clicky and feel robust, a joy to type on! (which is something I thought I'd never say about a laptop keyboard)I am not a power user, I do not use this laptop for heavy rendering or 3D graphics. I do not game on this laptop. I have a desktop in my office for those things. This handles what I actually use a laptop for really, really well. I love that I can go to a coffee shop with this thing, pull it out of my bag, and instantly open up to my 15 open tabs from my previous session and continue to keep working. The speed is insane, and there are no hitches. The battery life also is incredible. Big fan of the braided cable that comes with this. At the moment, I can get a few days of heavy browsing use out of this, which coming from my old pro model that would die in less than an hour on battery with the same workload, is nothing short of a miracle to me. Praise the M series chips!The screen quality is super sharp too, I'm sure it's the same or similar screen to my old Pro model, but the bezels make up for it. Sure, it may not have Promotion, or whatever the Apple term for 120hz is nowdays, but I personally don't mind it, and don't notice it. Again, this is not a poweruser device.So, at the moment, this is an incredible deal on a laptop.

    Great laptop, too small for my workflow",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024","Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.Specs-I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!",102,all,"Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size.

    High quality but questionable value and compatibility",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024","I've had this for a month now. I'm coming from windows. I also build my own gaming PCs and like to keep up on technology. I'm currently using this for grad school. This is my 2 cents on the Apple Air M3.The Good:-Very high quality external hardware and build (all aluminum, very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.- Highly compact build-Great battery life. I'm in grad school now and I've done 2 hours days without a charge.- Fast and responsive for the type of productivity I'm using it for.- ""Just works"" no major crashes or tech issues yetThe Bad:Fingerprint magnet in ""Midnight"" color. Collects smudges and finger prints very easily and visibly.-No Spotify app in the Apple store for MacBook (but is available for iPad and iPhone) I had to side download it off the Spotify website. Strange that Apple does not support this in their own store.- No virtual assistant choices. Google Assistant and Alexa are not available in the Apple store for Mac (but are available for iPad and iPhone). Cannot be officially downloaded either. Your stuck with Siri, which for me is an inferior virtual assistant and not compatible with many things outside of the Apple ecosystem such as Sony noise cancelling headphones ECT.- The M3 with 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and no dedicated GPU cost as much as much as my Windows gaming laptop from 7 years ago (2017) that had 16GB of ram and 512GB SSD and a powerful GPU. Those specs in 2024 are low/entry level for a premium device. The fact that Apple sells an 8GB 256GB SSD version of this device for as much as it does is really insulting, not future proof, nor anywhere near market value of that hardware. This is especially true if you use demanding software outside of the Apple ecosystem.Apple fans will cry the device does not need as much ram as a non ARM Windows device and thats true, but windows makes ARM laptops now and the year is 2024, a 7 year old laptop should not be competing with this device. It's overpriced and under speced.Conclusion: Overall this is a quality product and I have no regrets about buying it. I think it's good to be proficient in Windows and Mac. I like owning both systems. However the value of this product (and all apple products) is questionable.

    Beautiful machine, steep learning curve if you've never had a Mac",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024","When my beloved iPad Pro started rejecting its Smart Keyboard, I started looking for a replacement device - after replacing the Smart Keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone,  that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear.

I did a lot of research and decided that a MacBook Air might suit my needs better since the keyboard for the iPad Pro was the source of my problems with it. I thought since the MacBook Air is in the Apple family, and since I also have an iPhone, that the MacBook Air would work seamlessly and synch up with both the other Apple devices with no problems. Silly, silly me.The adjustment has been great because I have not used an actual laptop in years and have never used a Mac machine of any kind. I have read that it may take a couple of months to adjust so I am really trying to love it.Not being a tech person, I thought it might be helpful to others who are considering this purchase to share my thoughts.What I like: The MacBook Air is very thin and beautiful. (Thinner is always better, right?) The action of the keyboard is stellar - so smooth! - and the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear.

It flat-out refused to connect to all three of my office displays, which were Samsung E2020s from 2011-ish (VGA and DVI ports).

Then at home, MORE issues awaited when it wouldn't connect to my 2013-era ViewSonic VP2365 LED monitor, which works perfectly fine otherwise. My 2015 Air had no issue connecting to these displays.

Then at home, MORE issues awaited when it wouldn't connect to my 2013-era ViewSonic VP2365 LED monitor, which works perfectly fine otherwise. My 2015 Air had no issue connecting to these displays. Whatever changes Apple has made to their OS's error tolerance for video signals has just made customers' lives more painful and only helps contribute to more electronic waste, because I guarantee that other users are opting to buy new displays if their shiny new Mac won't connect to them.",0

    Everything I was looking for",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024",Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k.,136,all,Pretty good laptop.

I handed the laptop off to my brother and he said he went to the registry and took it off there. I forget some of the things that he told me did but yea he went INTO the laptops registry and was able to take it off there and he restarted  the computer and it was gone! now it runs fine but you wont be able to do much of heavy gaming which is what i bought for the laptop for in the first place! because it wouldn’t run any of the games i was trying i decided to use shadow. literally the best app to ever be created literally she can run anything from minecraft with high end shaders and loads of mods to sims 4 also packed with cc! so what im saying is if you buy this laptop to play games shadow is a GREAT thing to use it makes it so the laptop basically runs like a gaming pc. the games rarely lag unless she’s connected to our weaker internet!

    Amazed By This Cheap Laptop (1 Month in)",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024","If you were like me, looking for a college laptop that would not break the bank, look no further. I am literally writing this review on this laptop in class.I just wanted a (Windows) laptop that I can code on and do a couple assignments while on campus. I never have to worry about the battery dying on me unless it was already really low. It is surprisingly fast but obviously not as fast as a $2000 laptop. Fast enough I would say.Right out of the box, I was instantly very surprised at how good quality everything felt and looked. It is actually pretty large in size but not cumbersome. But as I keep using it I do have some nitpicks about it:- The screen portion is pretty bendable to the point where I feel like you can easily break it. Now I don't know who would do that on purpose but you should watch out.- No backlight on keyboard makes it hard to see keys in low light.- Keyboard feels sort of hollow. Probably because it is cheap.- Fan is noticeably loud, say if the class is quiet. But I do prefer it to be cool and be a little bit loud than it be hot.- Fan ramps up randomly. Like I could have a simple assignment up with 2 tabs open and it could kick on for some reason even though the workload is not much. Then other times I have a bunch of tabs and another application open but it will stay silent.Other than that it is perfect if you need a cheap laptop to get some work done at school or code like me. Definitely recommend.",57,all,"If you were like me, looking for a college laptop that would not break the bank, look no further.

I followed the instructions on how to fix it it’s still wouldn’t connect I had to other devices that were connected to the Internet with no issues. so at this point, I called the number given in case there was connection problems. It was an automated machine asking for the SNID number. I put that number in and the automated system said that this product was no longer under warranty. Of course, my first thought was what the hell I just got it today. So at this point, I spoke to a live person who transferred me to the company, ACER. I spoke with a very nice gentleman, and gave him the SN ID number as well as the serial number. Come to find out the computer warranty expired in 2019. This was a refurbished device that sold as new. It was counterfeit. To no fault of Amazon. I was told to call Amazon back as he was unable to transfer me and once again, I explained my story. The customer service rep was named Rocky and he was absolutely awesome. He was very apologetic and said I was handling it well he gave me some options and I chose to have it replaced, I received a new computer the following day by 7:15 in the morning .  I’m sharing this as I want people to be aware that this can happen and of course it happens to me.

    It Does What You Need",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2024","My MSI gaming laptop spontaneously died (after five years to be fair) and I got this thing as a replacement to be able to do my schoolwork. I was looking for something cheap and functional. I think this laptop fits the bill. It can handle the day to day tasks and unless you're looking to run some pretty beefy programs this will do what you need it to do. Right now I have 18 tabs open in Chrome and it's running just fine. The fan CAN get a little noisy if I'm streaming audio or video on discord, but most of the time it's silent. I haven't taken advantage of any upgrades yet, but, as other reviews mentioned, I'm glad to have the capability if I decide I want more storage or memory.I didn't have any problem turning S mode off. I managed to get my setup pretty much exactly how I wanted.The speakers and camera are about what you'd expect for the price point - a little grainy but workable.The only complaint I have with mine after a month is an occasional, soft buzzing from the monitor. Very quiet but definitely noticeable. (Addendum: The trackpad is also slightly wider than I think is necessary and sometimes the base of my thumb will change the mouse position while I'm typing)Overall, unless you're a CS student who needs lots of parallel processing capability or a gamer running any game released after 2010, this will cut it. Gaming laptops seem like a waste of space, so I'm glad to have this for my day to day and to invest in a desktop machine for my gaming needs.",3,all,"My MSI gaming laptop spontaneously died (after five years to be fair) and I got this thing as a replacement to be able to do my schoolwork.

    Very loud fan, but mostly good laptop for the price",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024","This laptop has been pretty good for me as a new college student. It performs pretty well and can even handle playing some games good. However the one thing that has really bothered me about this laptop is how loud it gets. I hate opening it in class because even if I just open one tab on Google, the fan goes crazy. It's incredibly embarrassing at times to use in class because of how loud it gets. I sometimes end up just turning it off and doing the work at home because of how loud it is. I don't know if it's just mine, and it's not like I have programs running in the background or anything like that, this can happen anywhere from when I first open the laptop to sitting idly on a blank Google doc with nothing else opened, it doesn't matter. But it's just unbearable to deal with sometimes.Another comment I have is originally I was expecting to get the gray laptop as advertised in the pictures, but when it arrived it was a navy blue. I'm not complaining though, it's pretty.Overall though I think it's a pretty good laptop and it does everything I need it to do.

This laptop is pretty much better in all it’s way, but that because of today technology. Honestly speaking, this laptop isn’t that great, but it’s good enough for what I need it for, which is good enough for me. For $300, and even less on sales.

Unless it’s an old MMO, you could probably get away with medium or higher, but don’t expect much. This thing may have “8” gb ram, but in honesty. You’re probably going to have around 3.5-4gb ram free, as window system will eat majority of it. My biggest complaint is that you can’t upgrade the ram, it’s sadly soldered on. Unlike the storage, which is upgradable, but do know you’ll have to reinstall window. The casing feels “light”, very light, enough to where to I don’t want to apply too much pressure as it might deform or bent it in a way, maybe cheap material. The display is….. uh do able? It’s very dim and the color is like off, very off, don’t expect to do any artsy stuff with correct colors. As for battery, it leaves a lot to be desire. Depending on what you’re doing you could be around 2-7hr battery life, so make sure to always keep it plugged in. The keyboard is fine, it’s nice to have a laptop with the side pad, it’s something I use for when I do light gaming. Other than, it’s a pretty all rounder budget laptop for a cheap price.

    Was I sold a used computer??",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2025","I was so happy to receive this laptop...I had been using an old Dell that has served me well, but was beginning to actually fall apart! lol  However, I have had soooo many issues with this Acer...shutting down and having to be restarted through the battery pinhole...tabs crashing...constant popups saying it couldn't find the network path or couldn't access C...wouldn't recognize brand new earbuds...screen just going black.  I did some research and found that Windows 11 Home S Mode was giving some users a lot of trouble and users found that taking it out of S Mode corrected many issues.  However, when I went in to take it out of S Mode, I found that ""someone?"" had already done that!  Was I sold a used computer?!  I've contacted Acer with my concerns.  They've instructed me to send the laptop to their repair center (at my expense).  I'm preparing to do that.  But I felt the need to write this review.  I'm still concerned that the computer I bought was not new.  When it does work, I really enjoy this little laptop.

    Tremendous laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2024","We buy hundreds of items from Amazon each year and I only write a review once/twice a year. When I write a review it is on something that I believe is an excellent value. This Acer laptop is the right laptop for anyone that does not game.

For anyone that is looking for a fast computer to surf the web and to use for home computing go no further...and spend no more. Previously we had an $1100 Lenovo that worked great and stopped working for us. This laptop works easily as well as our previous Lenovo. Remarkable.Two comments that may bother others. The speakers are not good and you will notice this almost immediately. This was of zero significance to me, but others may be put off.

    Very nice low cost laptop but wifi card not supported on Linux",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2024","Overall I'm very impressed with this laptop for the cost. Clear screen, decent battery life,  and pretty fast at doing the basics well.

I installed Linux Mint easily along side Windows 11, but no luck on the wifi. I have a USB Wifi stick on order and hopefully that will work, otherwise I may have to open it up and install a different wifi card.

    Good laptop",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023","***UPDATE* I apologize, I thought I had purchased a laptop with touchscreen but I forgot I made a very last minute decision not to. This laptop never advertised a touchscreen so there was no misleading information.*** This is a beautiful laptop, easy to use with a big, gorgeous screen. The updates were actually fairly quick, it connected to the internet with no problems. The only real thing I dislike is the fact that I got this laptop for school, and it came with Microsoft preinstalled, but I can't use it. It's been very frustrating trying to open it and get it installed especially since I have a subscription. I can only use the browser version, it's a bit counterproductive for convenience. I've been trying to troubleshoot and install it for over an hour now. On another note, the sound quality is good but the volume is pretty average even on max volume so using headphones would be best. Video is flawless and the browser is great! It holds a decent charge for at least 8 hours and the fan is so quiet, I literally didn't notice it. It's easy to navigate and use and basic user friendly. I say basic because I know there are a lot of people who like to really dig into their electronics and boost and enhance their stuff but I'm not one of those super tech savvy people.

I settled on this one after looking at reviews and once I got it started up I quickly realized that in order to download whatever apps you wanted onto it that were not Microsoft apps, you have to switch the computer out of S mode. I’m not a super techy person and I didn’t even know what S mode was, but I quickly googled it and realized that it is a freaking pain in the butt To switch out of. Microsoft makes it next to impossible to do this. After searching several online forums and trying multiple things that people suggested I finally was able to switch out of this mode and have the ability to download whatever apps I want. For example, the cricut app and chrome browser app cannot be downloaded while in s mode. All the time I spent trying to get out of S mode took probably three total hours.

I forget some of the things that he told me did but yea he went INTO the laptops registry and was able to take it off there and he restarted  the computer and it was gone! now it runs fine but you wont be able to do much of heavy gaming which is what i bought for the laptop for in the first place! because it wouldn’t run any of the games i was trying i decided to use shadow. literally the best app to ever be created literally she can run anything from minecraft with high end shaders and loads of mods to sims 4 also packed with cc! so what im saying is if you buy this laptop to play games shadow is a GREAT thing to use it makes it so the laptop basically runs like a gaming pc. the games rarely lag unless she’s connected to our weaker internet!

Microsoft makes it next to impossible to do this.

For example, the cricut app and chrome browser app cannot be downloaded while in s mode. All the time I spent trying to get out of S mode took probably three total hours.

    Disappointed :( - Maybe defective?",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025","I was so happy to buy this laptop so I can officially use Krita and can use my drawing tablet. I also just wanted a laptop for casual use too. I was hoping this was the perfect match, based on the reviews given. I think I just received a defective one maybe? It's only been around one (almost two months) months since I received this laptop, but I've ran into many issues. The screen has this burn thingy in it which I took a picture of. I never once damaged the laptop as far as I'm aware, though I use it daily- so it may be a burn. Also it overheats dramatically for some reason despite the fan and keeping it on a flat hard surface? And the battery will drain completely in two or so hours for me, even with energy saver. I'm just sad at this point. I don't want to return it because it has Krita files on it that I don't want to loose and I can't just- give myself the files somehow, so I have to keep this laptop. Oh well.

    Great price, if all you want to do is surf the net",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2024","Overall, very disappointed in this purchase. I should have done more diligence, and read more reviews on YouTube and other sites before buying this particular model laptop (the A 315 24P in the 7320U configuration). It's slow, sometimes freezes up with basic programs, and you can't upgrade RAM, which really hurts. Very misleading descriptions and advertising for this product. There are several similar model options, be very careful when comparing.Pros: Cheap, which is the big selling point here. Easy initial setup, boots quickly, lightweight, display quality is not horrible, decent battery life.Cons: It's slow...like really slow. I get stuck waiting to click on internet links, navigating back and forth between pages, and when using software programs...waiting for the computer to respond, and occasionally having to reboot. This is with plenty of space on the hard drive, also. The fact that you can't upgrade the RAM is really frustrating,the 8gb dual chips are soldered on, no way to change or upgrade.There is no backlit keyboardor touchscreen toggling, despite what the Amazon descriptions might lead you to believe. Sound quality from the onboard (tiny) speakers is horrible, even with my very low expectations for that. Super ""tinny"" and low volume.Overall, very disappointed.

    Not a good laptop",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2024","At first I was so excited to receive this laptop due to the massive amount of amazing reviews, however upon receiving this laptop I had already noticed some not great things.If you like big laptops this is definitely the one for you! I’m personally not a big fan of the size, it also wasn’t very slim. It was extremely difficult to fit in my laptop bag even though the bag was made for a 20 inch laptop such as this one. It’s very bulky in my opinion. When I turned it on it was already having issues. The noise from the fans is INSANE!!! If you want a quiet laptop for school I do not recommend this at all. It was super noisy. The other issue I had is that the computer was CONSTANTLY using half of the ram and due to the computer having 8gb of ram, that only left 4gb for anything else you need to do. Opening up browsers or really anything was super slow. It wasn’t easy to use at all. I ended up factory resetting it twice and it helped a little bit but not much. Pretty much the only thing that was good about this laptop was the keyboard. It was pretty nice and had a quiet sound. The laptops condition wasn’t great when I got it either. It had scratches in some areas. I ended up buying a refurbished dell laptop and it worked so much better.If you want to try this out for yourself go ahead, but I personally did not enjoy a second of the headache this laptop caused me. Returning wasn’t easy either and I found out this store is a third party store so the only way to return it is to print out the shipping label and wait for UPS to come by your house. You aren’t really given a time they will be there either and they definitely aren’t willing to work with you on it. So be prepared to stay home all day.On a good note it did come early!Edit: Forgot to mention, the computer comes on something called “S Mode” it basically blocks anything and everything that isn’t Microsoft based.

    Non upgradable system",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2024","I am a PC enthusiast since 1993. I've owned just about every product that has been produced by major manufacturers.  Compaq was the fist systems that had soldered hardware to the system board so it was non-upgradable and you had to purchase new hardware through the manufacturer to upgrade at the same PC price as a new one would have cost. This Laptop is a reminder of this design. While it comes with major system allowances to surf the internet, and upgradable SSD drive allocation, your performance will be hampered greatly. And being a AMD product, in most cases the system design is usually upgradeable.  I purchased for an online work project, sadly this laptop did not cut the performance needed to accomplish the task. Cheap design, quick work and really just a word processor at most. There is another model with the same id but the last 4 alphanumeric of the product is the key factor in its performance upgrades. this is capped at 8gb. This is the baseline for win 11 (Trust me, 8 gb is needed to run win 11 barely) best option is to wipe the system and go to win 10 if you have the know-how. This would be a decent laptop with advantages in both processing and video with win 10 OS. Gaming is unadvisable.",2,critical,"I am a PC enthusiast since 1993.

    overall solid pc, specs a bit misleading",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2023","The laptop runs as expected for the given specs. Pleased with how it runs and performs so far. Only big complaint is the listing states the CPU is 4.3 GHz, upon inspection it is actually 2.8 GHz (see screenshot). I'm pretty disappointed with that deception, hence the 3 stars. Upon looking at the CPU specs on AMD's website, the CPU base clock is 2.8 GHz and the max boost clock is 4.3 GHz. the real question is under what conditions you can use that upper range beyond 2.8. Maybe some settings in BIOS, an AMD performance management software, or maybe it's automatically managed?  Not sure, but I will have to investigate it further. (See other screenshot for general CPU specs from AMD's website)The only other annoyance is the touch pad seems a bit ""loose"" at the bottom of the pad.

For the graphically interesting games natively compatible with it, very good graphics performance. The display is amazing and is capable of twice as many pixels as it shows you. It was a good value in a Black Friday sale (~$1400), but this (M4 Pro 12/16) chip is on par with or under performance of the prior generation M3 Max 14”, so if it can get one of those for a good deal refurbished or open box, there is no shame in it. As with all M1/2/3/4s, there are dedicated neural cores for Apple Intelligence to run, which allows for a personalized Siri who listens to you and watches you all the time, without sharing this information. You can disable Apple Intelligence and Siri, but after I got past the creepiness, I configured Siri as an Irish Female, and it makes everything lovely. There is a lot of integration with other Apple devices, like you can operate your iphone from a distance on your MacBook. You can also receive texts and Messages from your iPhone, and easily use it for tethering, as a substitute for your webcam (the webcam is pretty solid nonetheless). This model supports linking hearing aids and also supports airpods much in the same way the iPhone does. You can easily use your living room TV as a second monitor on the fly, and if you can plug in via HDMI, you can get the whole 4K@120hz. MacOSX is a great operating system, built on Unix, and with tons of room for customization for beginners to super users. Time Machine backups with your own plug-in hard drives and iCloud are incredibly convenient. Safari gets better and better, but the Mac versions of Chromium and Firefox also dazzle.For most programs that aren’t games, macOSX is widely supported, but if you just *need* it, parallels desktop and vmware can run windows for you.New users ought to pay close attention to Tips and go into settings and learn all the trackpad gestures. You won’t want to come back to a different trackpad, and until you want to game, you will not care to use a mouse.Anyway, I got this for my wife as a gift, partly because she needed a new computer and partly because I wanted to convert her. She seems pretty converted.",73,all,"Very fast laptop, very long battery life. For the graphically interesting games natively compatible with it, very good graphics performance.

    Why are speaker holes on top?",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2024","I finally upgraded my 2015 MacBook Pro because it ran out of updates, the audio is getting wonky (after 9.5 yrs) and I needed the USB-C ports to connect portable SSD drives. I thought this 2024 model would be faster. I don't see any difference. I also had trouble deleting an installer app, which has never happened before with my old MacBook. There were errors in the file somehow, so it could not be dragged to Trash. Had to Google to figure out how to delete it (found it under Applications). I also thought getting a new laptop would make on the road internet connection more seamless. Nope. Same issues I had with my old laptop. I was able to connect with my hotspot, but then suddenly it just didn't work. Tried to reconnect again and it didn't work. Tried to pair my iPhone 15 Plus with my new laptop and it couldn't find the device under Bluetooth. Still need to figure out this part.PROS:The laptop itself is beautiful and feels a bit heavier than the 2015 model. I wanted to get black, but ended up with silver again because I was afraid of fingerprints. The charging block (with MagSafe) is smaller than the 2015 model. Love the long battery life because I edit photographs and those editing software drains the battery. The battery on my 2016 laptop is still alive by the way (after 9.5 yrs), but after 2 hrs of Lightroom use it needs to be charged.CONS:I don't like that the speaker holes are on top (where the keypads are) because it looks like it is easier to get messed up for accidental water spills. The speakers on my old laptop is hidden somewhere (maybe in the hinges of the fold). So be very careful with snacking/drinking around your laptop.Some new features I noticed compared to the 2015 model is that the mouse pad has a clicking feature. Before I just had to tap around, but now the corners of the mouse pad are like mouse clickers. I don't like it yet because I am not used to it. The whole laptop feels less responsive to me because of it, but it was easier for my husband to use because he is a PC/windows user and was always frustrated using my 2015 MacBook because he didn't know how to tap on the mousepad.I hope this laptop lasts me another decade like my last one did, but with the speaker holes on top I don't think the lifespan will be as long.The laptop comes with 1/2 the battery charged. I haven't charged it yet. With my old laptop I always leave it charged even when not in use.

    Got this because I am doing a whole lot more of everything: editing pictures, writing music, rendering videos, recording audio, and studying.Appearance:The screen is SO MUCH better than the M1 13-inch, and that extra-inch difference makes a difference when I am split-screening windows. The ports are nice to have, especially the SD card slot. I always used to carry around 2 dongles or USB-C hubs with me. Now I don't have to (unless I have to somehow use a VGA port for presentations or USB-A to connect wired mouse/keyboard).Transition:If you have a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 cable, just connect that between your old MacBook to the new one and set the old one to Migration Assistant in Utilities. The process was so fast at about 1.7 GB/s, and I had 200GB out of the 256GB old storage.Storage:Having a 512GB base storage is so nice compared to juggling with 256GB the last 4 years. The M1 MacBook Air is/was an excellent budget laptop during grad school even with the base 256GB storage. However, I'd always struggle to offload and download files when I got more photography gigs, especially dealing with RAW files. I averaged 200GB on and off, so seeing that I am still less than half of the 512GB storage now is comforting.RAM:The 16GB of RAM flies through my workload with ease. No more ""Swap Use"" Memory from the former 8GB RAM I had, which is a plus. I throw all sorts of demanding tasks including Google Chrome, LightRoom, Ableton + Nexus, LogicPro, FruityLoops Studio, etc. Still under the 16GB usage.My thoughts:Typing this on the new M4 MacBook Pro, and it is noticeably a better experience for my productivity and day-to-day workloads.

    Keys with too much open space and blinding light below them",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2025","Returned due to faulty keyboard. I really didn't like the keyboard layout that with every key raised with light shinning through at the bottom. If laying down watching a movie, all you see is light emitting out of all of the keys which is very distracting and uncomfortable. The keys make a ton of noise in comparison to other versions of Macbooks which was a HUGE DEALBREAKER for me. I did think of buying keyboard cover but then hesitated knowing that they get loose over time and fall off. The mouse pad also makes extra noise and uncomfortable to the touch when using even though I did think of a solution of buying a mouse pad sticker which meant I had to spend more of my personal time shopping around and waisting more money to fix a solution for an expensive laptop with major flaws. The keys on keyboard all have open spaces which was concerning due to the fact that it would become dust and particle collection trap, not to mention higher risk for damage if something is spilled onto it by accident. The keys on the keyboard that I received were all raised to a different level, I could see varying amount of light coming through on all of the keys, THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE RETURN. This laptop was also a little bit thicker which I could have gotten used to but still unappealing. I was so disappointed with this model and will be making sure to stop by a brick and mortar store next time to test out the future models in person prior making a purchase from Amazon. Other than that, if this computer was gifted to me free of charge or if it costed under $200, I would most likely buy and keep it, find mouse pad stickers and keyboard covers, buy them in bulk and use them over the years when the old ones go bad.

    Screen developed hardware issue at 4 years old.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025","Almost exactly 4 years after I purchased my MacBook Pro, the screen developed a hardware issue. I ordered my MacBook Pro 02/18/2021. The screen went bad yesterday 02/20/2025. Just like THAT. I have never abused my MacBook Pro. Yesterday afternoon, I was using it and suddenly, silently, and irrevocably, the lower quarter of the screen displayed horizontal, gray, flickering lines.

    Display broke after one month -  Warranty",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024","I purchased this in July for my daughter for college. She began using it in August, but after one month, the display stopped working. Because it was over 30 days since my purchase in July, I could not return it to Amazon. After talking to HP support to troubleshoot the issue, they said that the device was defective, but they could not cover it under the one year warranty because the hardware configuration had changed from what they had sold to Amazon. In other words, HP sold the laptop to Amazon, but Amazon then modified the device (adding more RAM, bigger hard drive, etc.), and in doing so, it voided the HP Warranty. This left me in no mans land in terms of getting it fixed; it was a battle between me, HP, and Amazon. After several support and customer service calls, Amazon agreed to allow me to return it.

    Great laptop for more then gaming.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2025",It's a good laptop.My first time buying from ROG and I'd say it has been a good buy.The laptop runs everything I throw at it well.

    Excellent Deal! Great Gaming Laptop!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023","I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday! Excellent purchase! Here is my pros and cons after a week of owning this:Con:1. 1920 x 1200 FHD 165Hz Display is very much an downgrade against my Legion 5 Pro 16"" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD 165Hz Display... But I guess with the parts offered, ASUS had to make some budget cuts somewhere I guess... (for the model I've chosen and not wanting to spend more than $1500 USD).2. Automatic MUX Switching is annoying... it optimizes which option to best suit for your current usage at the time (e.g. if you ran an game vs closing the game and brings you to the desktop). The automatic switch seems like its great and all but it ruins the display setting and when an game is playing, it switches again and sends you back to the desktop and ruins the display setting/resolution once more... Its best to just set it on the dedicated GPU option so you dont have to deal with this...3. Standard SSD Capacity is too low (again with cost saving measures but literally everyone these days just buy additional SSD stick anyways)... so snagged an SK.Hynix P41 SSD 2TB stick on sale to manually install for loading heavy application and games on there; really easy to install and easy to unscrew the back; there is an empty NVMe Gen4 M.2 2280 slot for you to install your SSDWorks Great after installing correctly and no Issues now! (make sure after install of SSD, just load into Windows and open up disk management to reformat (quick format! never full on SSD!) No need to tinker with BIOS setting...Do not tighten the SSD screws too much where the stick bends! thats incorrect! screw in ever so slightly so that the stick itself wont lodge out or move at all.Pros:1. RTX 4060 8GB - 140W Max TGP2. i7-13650HX - beats my Ryzen-7 5800H on my Legion 5 Pro3. RGB bar looks awesome!4. Battery 90WhNeutral:1. RGB Keys - heard mixed reviews on ASUS's design on this; of course, the Legion 5 RGB keyboard design is the best of the best but this is just okay and its not too bad in my eyes.2. Same weight and nearly the same dimensions as my Legion 5 Pro so portability is the same-ish but way better than my old MSI gaming laptop from 2017 where you can put this in your backpack and still have room to put other accessories and such.This is all I've noticed currently but either way, its a great mid-tier gaming laptop! I can run cyberpunk all max setting without issues or framerate drops and every other AAA game titles up to this point... This laptop should last an long time until AAA games becomes more graphically intense and requiring more processing power... but again this is the best you can get for your money and highly recommend!",219,all,"I wanted to buy another laptop for work purposes but also be useful for travelling and for gaming so I saw this laptop for sale during Black Friday!

    Amazing machine",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","It's a big and beautiful laptop that slurps up all games like jam while staying very quiet by laptop standards. Expect high framerates and few frame dips thanks to high CPU limits, but with a few caveats.Pros:1. It is insanely fast and quiet. Balanced mode fans are around 40 dB (about as quiet as a desktop) but you can make them run much louder in Turbo mode.2. Good display. The 165Hz screen is quite good and fast, slightly better gamut then my previous laptop. The 16:10 ratio is also really nice for games and productivity apps. Mine has a slight green tint but only when using the iGPU, switching to Nvidia removes it. Which means it's probably a software issue (see ""Cons"" below)3. It runs cool. While playing endgame Dyson Sphere Program (basically a CPU stress test) the CPU doesn't even reach 80 degrees and manages to squeeze out 60+ fps where my old Ryzen 7 4800H would crap out and struggle to cough up 35 fps.Cons:1. Asus software is horrible, it's like it was coded by interns. This is the main reason I took one star off the review, out of the box MyAsus and Armoury Crate hog CPU and RAM and are constantly fighting against Windows' settings and each other. They can cause constant freezes and weird bugouts like the screen colors going haywire. Even after replacing them with G Helper, there are still a few lingering issues I have to be wary of.2. Bad battery life. Out of the box it runs like 5 hours max, 4 hours if you disable the screen battery saver (60 Hz is nauseating). Definitely going to need to lug that huge power brick around.3. The middle fan is very high-pitched like the ones you'd find in thinner laptops. It can be distracting for some, personally I'm on the fence. It is still very quiet and even gets drowned out by external speakers or headphones.4. Gaudy design. The lightbar is obviously annoying and the keys are pretty much unreadable without backlight on, which I really hate. The 4-zone RGB keyboard is also poorly executed, it looks patchy and has very limited color range. Typing on it feels very good though, it has full-size keys, high travel and good feedback. I just wish it had a numpad or a dedicated Home, End, PgUp and PGDown keys, there's a lot of wasted space on the deck.Overall I'm still very happy with my package, would recommend it to anyone who wants a well cooled laptop with insanely high performance with a tradeoff of portability and battery.And Asus, please fix your damn software.",46,all,"It's a big and beautiful laptop that slurps up all games like jam while staying very quiet by laptop standards.

    NOT 16 inches",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025","My sister and I were both getting new laptops and my sister chose this one. Right off the bat we noticed how much smaller it was than anticipated. For reference, I previously had a 15inch computer and quickly saw this looked much smaller and I was correct.We measured and it’s approx 13.5 inches with an active screen of about 13inches.This was really important since we needed laptops that would fully utilize the cintiq 16 aspect ratio and laptops of a smaller size usually results in a smaller working area on the tablet.My sister still wanted to try and see if 13 inches would be enough and sadly it was not. It’s a big shame too because the laptop seems very well made. I’ve had an ASUS in the past and it lasted me a while so I trust the manufacturer. The silent fans really ARE very silent. The quietest laptop we’ve ever seen. The logo sound is a bit of a jumpscare when turning on the laptop though (it’s the sound of two blades), but I’m sure there’s a way you can turn that off if you’d like. We didn’t get past the set up since we just wanted to see if it was compatible with the Cintiq.Making this review so that other people know about the incorrect size listing. If you don’t mind getting a laptop that’s three inches smaller than anticipated then this seems like a good choice. If size does in fact matter to you then please look elsewhere. But also keep in mind, this isn’t the only wrong size listing. The Acer 17 laptop I got was in fact 15 inches despite the description. 15 at least uses the full Cintiq work area so I didn’t need to return mine but again it’s weird that you have to assume that what’s listed in the description is going to be off by two to three inches.

    Love it!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2025","I purchased the ASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop in November 2024 as a Christmas gift to myself. I wanted to wait a few months and give it some serious work before writing a review.I wanted a gaming laptop that I could also use for some work applications as well. This laptop does everything I need and more! I've used it on games like World of Tanks, Fortnite and Call of Duty. The 16gb ram handles everything with no issues! I've recently started using it for some astrophotography processing and again, it does everything I need with no issues.I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but for the price and since most of the reviews were positive, I went ahead and pulled the trigger.

ASUS may be my new go to!If there is any downside, it would be the keyboard. The function is great, the lights are pretty cool, even though I just needed them be backlit, but the colors are ok too. But the only downsides to me are the Q,W,E,R,A,S,D and F keys are clear which make them hard to see. I assume it was done that way since they are the ones used most in gaming, but it's just an annoyance to me.

    A good upgrade, but could be better",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2025","I had a 2019 model of an ASUS gaming laptop for the last five years, and I was excited to make a much needed upgrade to this one. I'm currently writing this review on the laptop lol. The laptop is sleek and stylish, notably bigger than previous models, and has a decent battery life in a world where laptops seemingly get worse and worse battery life.

No creo que sea un problema grave.-A veces las aplicaciones fallaban, se congelaba y se reiniciaba solo (no sucedía muy seguido). He realizado diagnósticos para saber si algún componente provocaba estos errores pero no se encontró ningún problema, y hasta ahora descubrí que las apps de Asus (myasus y armoury crate) era lo que provocaba el tema de que las apps se cierren o que se congelara el portátil, así que las reinstale y actualmente se corrigió la mayoría de esos errores, pero aun suele dejar de funcionar el explorador de archivos, la barra de tareas y pocas veces las apps se dejan de funcionar. Así que recomiendo reinstalar las apps de Windows, restablecer la BIOS al modo fabrica y reinstalar Windows (que es lo próximo que hare porque estoy seguro de que solo es problemas con Windows que tal vez se configuro mal durante la instalación)*No me gusto la parte de atrás ya que viene con relieves lo que dificulta usar soportes, es por eso que tuve que colocar los soportes uno mas abajo que el otro para poder nivelarlo, pero recomiendo colocar soportes en la parte de atrás para que el aire pueda circular mejor, además que también sirve para que el cable del cargador pueda bajar un poco para que no se caliente por la salida de aire (como esta en la imagen).*En cuanto a juegos Assassin's creed syndicate en gráficos máximos da hasta 60 fps (es el único juego que he instalado hasta ahora).*La pantalla no es de tan alta resolución si eres exigente en ese aspecto, pero se mira muy bien.*La batería dura 2 horas mirando peliculas, que es lo normal en laptop gamer (en armoury crate en modo gpu, viene seleccionado ""estándar"" recomiendo seleccionar ""optimizado"" que hará que la RTX se desactive y solo use la grafica integrada) esto hará durar un poco mas la batería, también activar el ahorro de batería.*un consejo, si no te reconoce la RTX, intenta cambiando el modo gpu en armoury crate.En resumen, me gusta mucho este portátil y fue una buena compra. También decir que hable con el vendedor explicando los problemas que tenia la laptop y me dio la opción de devolverlo para el reembolso (me indico que se revisaba la falla y según eso el envió de la devolución se me devolvía y me daba el reembolso) pero como explique, solo es cuestión de reinstalar.",6,all,"i7-13650HX 13th, llego con algunas fallas .-un leve ruido internamente que no proviene de los ventiladores y aun no lo he abierto para ver de donde viene el ruido (no sucede seguido, solo es algunas veces) y no afecta para nada en el rendimiento, se puede jugar, editar y todo normal.

There is 2 things I want to point out. This gaming laptop has upgradable memory ram with 2 slots. Asus indicates that the maximum memory that can be installed is 32gb. I did a lot of research and I had messaged Crucial since the memory cards or sticks what ever you want to call them are compatible with this laptop. I asked if the 64gb which comes in a kit with 2x32gb sticks is compatible with the asus rog strix g16 g614jv model, they replied back to me and confirmed that ""YES"" this laptop memory ram can be upgraded to 64gb. How ever you have to buy the one that has the same speed as what the laptop has, since this laptop has a DDR5 4800hz sodimm stick that's what you're going to have to get. The memory ram comes in multiple of 2, i.e. this laptop comes with 2x8gb (16gb) .. If you want to add 32gb then you would have to get the kit that comes with 2x16gb and then 2x32gb (64gb). I upgraded to 64gb and had no problems installation was easy. Id did take about 3-5 minutes for the laptop to recognize the upgraded memory ram. Now same thing goes with the SSD storage Asus indicates that maximum storage is 2tb. I bought the 4tb Samsung 990 evo plus and installed it as the main Boot up OS C: drive. Of course you have to clone the SSD drive that come with the laptop but my point is that you can upgrade the SSD to 4tb. With this new upgrade my laptop is a beast. This laptop is worth it.

    The specs are really good for this laptop. I love how you can even play with 100 FPS or even more in some games (Halo infinite,  Apex Legends, The Finals) with the silent mode (without overheating or having the max power of the CPU/GPU). If you want to get over 100+, the turbo mode (taking full advantage of the GPU/CPU) will be great + the 165.1 Hz. The only ""issue"" (not issue honestly if you do not see this as problem) is the turbo mode makes the laptop sounds a bit loudly which is normally when you are utilizing it with the full capacity. Other than that, you can have an amazing experience playing on this mode.This version specifically does not have the numeric pad included. I originally thought it was going to be, but the i9 version has it, this one does not.Sound experience is good enough considering this is a gaming laptop, but by using headsets, the sound changes considerably, so good point to have the direct connectionWifi is the fastest and best one I've ever seen personally. I have played online getting 80+ pin (considering I'm from Colombia and pin does not get below that normally) easily. The experience can change a bit with cable, but there is not a big change at least on my end. Long story short, wifi is really attractive if you do not mind losing or having some ms more.Finally, this is something NOT related to the laptop. When I placed the order, I trusted on the platform by adding ""automatic"" location. This caused a delay of 5 business days. I contacted Amazon and the delivery company and Amazon could not change the shipment address because it had been already shipped. After several back and forth calls, none of the companies was able to support or make it faster which I understand, but I felt super uncomfortable knowing my order was in my city and Amazon did not attempt to address the situation.

    My First ever Laptop it soo good definetly worth it. Only one downside though",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2023","Disclaimer: I am writing this review to avail 90 day warranty extensionI am writing this review almost two months after I received this beast. It has been a smooth-ish experience. It is amazing for the price. I like that it can run all my games, and I have also used it for programming. It is definitely good as an all-rounder. The battery life is unexpectedly good. Once it reached more than seven hours, which is supreme for a Windows machine. I like the large trackpad. The RGB is also a good addition. Though the laptop becomes loud in turbo mode, I find myself keeping it on either silent or balanced mode, depending on the FPS I am trying to achieve.It runs Cyberpunk max settings with path tracing at 80 FPS native resolution with DLSS Quality at 70 FPS. I can confidently say it can run every game out there at max settings.The only downside is the SSD. Maybe it is just my model, or I am not sure, but the laptop becomes extremely slow while downloading games from Steam, Epic Games, etc. It is almost unusable. Task Manager shows disk at 100% while showing only 50 MB/s writes, which are initially 200, etc. I am not sure about this, but it is not much of a hassle. I only notice it when games are updating or installing. I guess they had to cut corners to make this such a great price. The Black Friday sale made this laptop even more worth it. I paid 1300$ because it had to be shipped to Qatar. It is much cheaper than the alternatives here, though, so worth it.Overall, I am giving this laptop a 5 stars. If only the SSD was better, this would be a perfect laptop. I guess I will probably buy a better SSD later, as this laptop has two NVMe slots.",25,all,"Disclaimer: I am writing this review to avail 90 day warranty extensionI am writing this review almost two months after I received this beast.

It runs well for gaming, hitting max settings for Baldurs Gate 3 and Elden Ring. I only experience small stutters in Elden ring. My main cons are that the battery life is extremely short. Luckily I usually have it plugged in so it's not a problem, but if you plan to use it off charger you might want to look elsewhere.

    If you're looking for a great laptop, this is it!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","I had been looking at replacing my old HP laptop for a while now but WOW was this so much more than I expected! My HP played Baldur's Gate 3 at an average of a whopping 7 fps and that was a painful experience. The load times were god awful. The Asus ROG STRIX g16, though, has no trouble running it, even if I push everything to the highest settings possible. I usually get somewhere between 42 fps and 63 fps minimum now during my sessions. The Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail benchmark also runs beautifully, which I'm very pleased about since the whole point in upgrading my computer was so I met the minimum requirements for Dawntrail when it releases.The packaging for this laptop was really nice. Opening it was just as much of an experience as turning it on for the first time. The keyboard feels great when typing and I love that the little bumps that help you figure out where your fingers are without looking includes W. It's an incredibly customizable laptop as well with easy to access bays for the hard drives. I haven't upgraded mine yet, but it'll be a breeze when I get around to it.Overall, I'm in love with this laptop. I knew I'd like it based on reviews and specs, but I ended up liking it even more than I expected to. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade without paying $2000+ for a computer. I had honestly thought to build a desktop but I need the portability of a laptop.

    Be wary",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2025","Bought this laptop as a stopgap between a rig and a Steamdeck until I could save up enough money to build my own tower. Once I built my tower, I relegated this laptop for my office, something to game on when I had free time. However, after about 5 months of owning this device, I noticed that there was a blatant performance issue with games that had intense requirements for graphics processing that wasn't present when I initially bought the device. Everything was working perfectly until one random day it was struggling to run pretty much every single game in my Steam library, even on minimal graphics settings.At this point I've done everything but replace the motherboard on it: driver reinstalls, complete device wipe, plugged it into multiple different power sources. I've taken it to people 3 different times, each of them all did something different and none of them were able to solve the issue. At this point I'll have to send it in to Asus, which is massively inconvenient for me because they ship through FedEx, arguably the worst mail system to curse this planet.I have my suspicion that this is because of the Intel processor fiasco that happened in early 2024 where the CPU's started to burn themselves out, as I've been told multiple times my issue is supposedly a processor issue.

It did have a message to plug in the laptop even though it was 95% charged.  I exited the bios and powered off/on.  Same thing.  I decided to plug it in and powered off/on again and let it along.  After 10 or so minutes, I see what you see in the video.  Seemed like it wanted my attention so I press a key and there's Windows.  Ok, that looks good.  But why is it flashing like that?

    A great gaming/all around laptop, not perfect but close to it.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2023","Rceiving a warranty extension from ASUS for this Review*Right out of the gate this laptop is impressive. Everything I've thrown at it, it's played very well. The new 40 series graphics cards features really help with this. The laptop is sturdily built with no deck flex around the keyboard.

Performance difference between Ultimate (MUX) and Standard (advanced optimus) mode is negligible.Relatively quiet (compared to my Alienware X17)Decent battery life when not gaming (5 to 6 hours web / video use)Has a webcam (720p) although it seems to be not Windows Hello compatible.Decent CPU performance for the price (14 core / 20 thread / 24MB L3 cache / 4.9Ghz)Minuses:My unit never reaches the rated 140w TGP of the 4060. It maxed out at 87w in standard mode under stress test (Furmark). For stability testing, it reached 111w with Afterburner overclocking (plus 267mhz core 367 mem). Max temp was low to mid 70s c. I think I will keep stock settings because it's primary use is going to be film/media school work for my child (Blender, Adobe Premiere, and other content creation stuff etc)Wanted to upgrade to 64Gb memory but website specs says 32Gb is the maximum supported.Edited (updated): changed my review to 5 stars. Finally able to get the GPU to utilize 140w (and a lil bit more) without manual OC (used Turbo mode). Turned on Extreme Burn in and Post FX in Furnark (artificial GPU stress testing tool)",1

I've seen this stated elsewhere in reviews and I too have to say that it has rare stuttering issues where a game or other program will freeze suddenly for about a second or two before resuming. It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.The larger problems, to me, are that the touchpad is absolutely massive, way bigger than my old laptop, and I have to keep it disabled constantly because it's way too easy to accidentally press when typing, and that the screw for the second M.2 SSD slot cannot be removed. I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw. I plugged in an SSD anyway and am just using the laptop case to hold it in place, which has a risk of it popping out, though said risk is lessened by me not taking my laptop with me outside anywhere so there's very little chance of it being jostled.",8,all,"Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it.

    No one told me about (H)Armory Crate",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024","When I needed to look for a new laptop, I considered going back to Windows since it’s both cheaper and less nuanced than using a MacBook Pro. I saw this on Amazon for sale and thought to myself “this could be a great fit for me.” I was wrong, however.When going to set up everything, there were two things that made me want to give up on making this my new computer.For one, editing things was a pain. The RGB lighting, which I was a little excited about, just wouldn’t change without something that plagues every gaming laptop ASUS offers; Armory Crate.

    Great but has issues",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2023","Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it. I've seen this stated elsewhere in reviews and I too have to say that it has rare stuttering issues where a game or other program will freeze suddenly for about a second or two before resuming. It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.The larger problems, to me, are that the touchpad is absolutely massive, way bigger than my old laptop, and I have to keep it disabled constantly because it's way too easy to accidentally press when typing, and that the screw for the second M.2 SSD slot cannot be removed. I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw. I plugged in an SSD anyway and am just using the laptop case to hold it in place, which has a risk of it popping out, though said risk is lessened by me not taking my laptop with me outside anywhere so there's very little chance of it being jostled.",8,critical,"Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it.

Once you succeed, it will take you straight to windows and you will find your free Microsoft there and all you have to do is click on word and accept license. (Also this process helps you get off windows s mood) That way you can enjoy your Laptop.Also, if you email is already tied to a 365 account it will be wise to use a neutral email as this may interfer with you getting the decline offer button.

    Very satisfied with this purchase",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2025","Just what I was looking for: a light-weight HP laptop that has Microsoft lifetime non-subscription,  upgraded features. I've been satisfactorily using Windows 10 on two 17-inch laptops (an HP and a Lenovo) for several years. But when Microsoft announced not supporting WIN 10 and encouraging the installation of WIN 11, I knew I would have to ""bite the bullet"" and upgrade before I ended up having to buy Windows 11. WIN 11 comes pre-installed. I've become accustomed to using Office suites since the mid-90s (okay, okay I'm now 78).  Free pre-installation of the latest of the non-subscription Office suites (2024) was a big plus when considering the purchase of this new laptop.  I hope I'm all set for the rest of my life.  I was also looking for a laptop that--as I age--I could much more easily carry around the house than I can right now carry my 17-inchers.  (It could also be easier to carry when I pack up other personals if ever notified to evacuate due to fire, wind, or earthquake.) Also, realizing that I didn't necessarily need a 17-inch laptop any longer, I chose a less expensive 15-incher. By the way, validating the pre-installed Office 2019 is easy. Just don't hurry, read everything on the screen as you work toward validation, and you'll be done with that step in four minutes! Watch that you do not install Microsoft 365 'cause you'll have to pay for and subscribe to it. If you don't need it, then Office is truly adequate for you. The legal pre-installed version of Office 2019 is genuine Microsoft software that does not come with a product key and, therefore, it does not need to be registered with Microsoft.  (If you have an online Microsoft account, it's up to you if you want to register the laptop itself.)  One more thing, once you're done with setup process, you'll notice that OneDrive is the default for synchronizing. If you're not familiar with OneDrive, go online to understand what it's for and how it works. Contact the seller via Amazon's communication feature for anything. Just click his name on the right side of the product description page and you'll arrive at the seller's profile with the link for communication in the upper right corner.",23,all,"Just what I was looking for: a light-weight HP laptop that has Microsoft lifetime non-subscription, upgraded features.

    Excellent as a secondary computer, not ideal as a primary computer.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2025","I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return. So far, I've been liking it a lot. I had an Intel MacBook Air computer and the keyboard was awful. If I used it for too long and pressed the buttons my fingers would hurt. That was my main reason for upgrading. So when I saw that Amazon was selling the MacBook M2 Air for $799, I jumped at the opportunity.So let's first preface this review for what this computer is NOT. This computer is not the most powerful computer ever. It's very fast and snappy. It open apps without a problem (such as Safari, Messenger, Discord, Facebook Messenger, etc.) You won't have any issues with it if you use primary web-based applications. Think Google Sheets, Google Word, Microsoft Office Suite, Asana, the list goes on and on. If you need a computer to use web-based applications this computer is ideal for that usage. The MacBook Air M2 is ideal if you have a secondary computer at home for certain tasks, such as printing and scanning documents.You should have your desktop computer at home - this will allow you to do things this computer cannot, such as printing documents or playing certain types of video games. Unfortunately, if you need to connect anything with a USB-A port, you're out of luck. This means you need to buy an extra connector for USB thumb drives, SD cards, external hard drives, web-cams, and other USB enabled devices. Ideally, you need to buy Apple's adapter. Unfortunately not all adapters are made equal. I had an old UGreen USC Hub that I used to connect my old laptop to my monitor. This MacBook Air M2 did not accept that, so I had to buy an Apple Official USB to HDMI converter to connect it. (which cost me $50 at the Apple Store). I later learned that this was because of the software of the computer. I think that it's a little insidious of Apple to not allow certain hardware to work because of a software block. This is a MacBook, not a Windows Book. While you do have the option to install Parallels on this computer, ideally this computer is meant to run a Mac Operating System. There will be certain programs and apps that just won't work. I got this computer and it had MacOS Sequoia pre-installed. I really like it. Unfortunately I can't downgrade to older versions of MacOS such as Ventura or Sonoma even those this computer originally supported it. So be aware if this is a feature that is important to you.I will never use this computer to its full potential. I am not a video editor, nor do I edit pictures on my computer. This computer is ideal for those tasks. However I doubt that 80 to 90 percent of the people are going to buy this computer to perform those tasks. Most of my use-case for this computer will be applying for jobs online, checking my bank account balance, taking random notes throughout the day, and buying things on Amazon. So essentially I am using this computer almost like an Apple Chromebook. It's excellent to go on the internet with and watch movies. And it's also excellent if you want to write documents, chat with friends, and do some light tasks like playing Terraria and Minecraft on your computer.Let's talk about Apple's pricing strategy and FOMO for a second. Very few people need 24 GB of RAM and 1 Terabyte of storage. It's more ideal to buy a pre-built computer or buy a used Desktop iMac if you need this computer for certain scenarios, such as editing videos, computing AI or computer algorithms, or building a network server at home. Your money will stretch much further. I got the 16GB model and so far I love the computer. It wouldn't matter if you got 8GB or an upgraded version.What I've learned with Apple computers is that if you have 8GB of memory, the Apple Operating System will use close to 8GB just by doing basic tasks like surfing the web and watching videos. If you have 16GB the computer will use close to 16GB just by doing basic tasks. So just get the best computer with the budget you have now. 8GB will perform close to 16GB - the only difference is that you can have more applications open at once with the 16GB.Ultimately, this computer is probably meant to be disposable. There's no way to upgrade the RAM or the Hard Drive. If the screen breaks, I'm sure that the screen would cost at least 500-600 dollars to replace. At that point it's probably a better idea just to get a new computer. It's a shame that Apple doesn't make their computers upgradable anymore. It gives consumers more choice after a year or two if their needs change.Ok enough bashing of this computer. Let's talk positives.This keyboard is luxurious to type on. My old Intel MacBook with the Butterfly keys gave me pain so I would have to stop every hour or two. I hated typing on that thing. This review was typed up on an MacBook Air M2 and I just love how the keys feel.The speakers are great. They're not the best, but they are excellent compared to many Dell laptops I used.The function keys on the top are useful. Volume Up and Down, Brightness Up and Down are really handy in a pinch. On Windows Machines you have to click or you have to press two keys in order to change the screen brightness or volume. I love the fact that you can adjust it with a press of a button.The screen is high quality. Again it is not the most brightest laptop screen that I've used. It is more that good enough for use indoors or outdoors.The trackpad click is very satisfying to click on.  It's awesome. I don't use my mouse sometimes, just the trackpad.I don't use the webcam, but I've heard good things about it. It's good enough for most people who need Microsoft Teams or Zoom.The battery is excellent. You never have to worry about battery life. I used to have a 2014 MacBook Air and the battery of that computer would die after 3 hours so I would have to carry a charger around. You don't have to worry about that issue with this computer. I've gotten all-day battery life just doing basic tasks such as browsing Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft Excel.I think this computer is stylish. I got the Starlight version and it's a slightly yellowish/champagne color.This computer is excellent so far and I've been enjoying it.So here would be the customer that ideally should buy this laptop.-if you want an M Series computer - get it.-if you're tired of Apple's butter keyboard -get it.-if you have an iPhone -get it because you can sync your messages to this computer-if you hate Windows OS like me lol - get it-if you have an Intel Based Mac and you want to try what else is out there- get it-if you want all-day battery life- get it-if you're willing to spend another 20-50 dollars after you buy this computer for the necessary dongles and connectors - get it-if you're willing to accept that this computer is non-upgradable and you might need to upgrade again in 3-4 years- get it.",37,all,"I bought this MacBook Air in February with my tax return.

    Do NOT buy an Apple laptop from Amazon!",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2025","If I could give zero stars, I would!I thought I was getting an amazing deal on a slightly older model, but new MacBook Air from the Apple Store. My laptop arrived seemingly brand new right out of the box. I plugged it in and began setting it up. Within about 15 minutes, the screen started glitching so I left it charging and put the laptop aside.Over the next three days, the laptop wouldn't hold a charge. The amber light on the charger would light up for a few seconds, the laptop would automatically restart, and it would shut down again. I tried using different outlets, surge protectors, chargers, and even charging ports. Nothing worked!I went immediately to an Apple Store to have them look at the laptop. This is where the red flags started to appear. I was told that if the laptop was defective, they could replace it...until they found out I bought it from the Apple Store on Amazon. I was told that buying Apple products from 3rd party vendors like Amazon is ""really dangerous"". I waited to talk to a technician. What I learned is that Amazon buys products from Apple and then re-sells them. My warranty, which is usually good for a year, had only 38 days left. And the computer had a hardware issue. If I asked them to repair the laptop, it would void what little warranty I had left.I immediately tried to initiate a return. I could not return the item without speaking to Amazon customer support. After repeatedly chatting and talking with two separate agents, neither of whom could easily assist me, I finally had the return approved.I happened to be sitting outside an Amazon pick-up/return counter at Whole Foods, but I soon learned that they could not process the return. I needed to re-pack the laptop, print and place a mailing label, and take it to USPS. When I went to USPS, I realized that I needed to pay $24.80 in shipping costs. And since I don't live in the continental U.S., it is now being sent via cargo ship. It will take at least 3 weeks to arrive. I will then need to wait 14-30 days before receiving my refund...if the package is not damaged. And after the three weeks it will take for the package to get sent back to Amazon, the return window will have closed.Meanwhile, I purchased a newer model version of the same laptop directly from Apple.

My laptop arrived seemingly brand new right out of the box. I plugged it in and began setting it up. Within about 15 minutes, the screen started glitching so I left it charging and put the laptop aside.Over the next three days, the laptop wouldn't hold a charge. The amber light on the charger would light up for a few seconds, the laptop would automatically restart, and it would shut down again. I tried using different outlets, surge protectors, chargers, and even charging ports. Nothing worked!I went immediately to an Apple Store to have them look at the laptop. This is where the red flags started to appear. I was told that if the laptop was defective, they could replace it...until they found out I bought it from the Apple Store on Amazon. I was told that buying Apple products from 3rd party vendors like Amazon is ""really dangerous"". I waited to talk to a technician. What I learned is that Amazon buys products from Apple and then re-sells them. My warranty, which is usually good for a year, had only 38 days left. And the computer had a hardware issue. If I asked them to repair the laptop, it would void what little warranty I had left.I immediately tried to initiate a return. I could not return the item without speaking to Amazon customer support. After repeatedly chatting and talking with two separate agents, neither of whom could easily assist me, I finally had the return approved.I happened to be sitting outside an Amazon pick-up/return counter at Whole Foods, but I soon learned that they could not process the return. I needed to re-pack the laptop, print and place a mailing label, and take it to USPS. When I went to USPS, I realized that I needed to pay $24.80 in shipping costs. And since I don't live in the continental U.S., it is now being sent via cargo ship. It will take at least 3 weeks to arrive. I will then need to wait 14-30 days before receiving my refund...if the package is not damaged. And after the three weeks it will take for the package to get sent back to Amazon, the return window will have closed.Meanwhile, I purchased a newer model version of the same laptop directly from Apple.

So to get a decent laptop you must shell out an additional $400 dollars (so that you are paying over $1200 to get a decent configuration.)

Sadly you can buy better laptops that actually include graphics cards to give you better studio editing with less restrictions by just getting really any other brand. To ask a thousand dollars for a laptop in this day and age when you can find laptops for $600 with a nvidia rtx 3050 and same specs is literally insane and people who buy these products?Know nothing about technology 😑. I'm not trying to make fun of people who buy apple products but you could choose better products. Dispense your money on weigh better products and that's all I'm trying to say. I wish people would just stop wasting their money on apple because you're just supporting a company that doesn't innovate, but charges more for nothing because they know you will buy it.

    Love love love this Macbook Pro!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2025","I found this Macbook for a little less than Apple offered it, so it was a no-brainer as far as the cost comparison.

    Powerful. Bit heavy. Quality through and through, as expected from Apple.",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025","I've owned this MacBook Pro M4Pro for a few weeks, and very impressed with the power and design. I do have to admit that it's a bit heavier than I expected. My previous laptop was an intel MacBook Pro, 15 inch retina. But, the trade off for larger and better quality display, and the performance gains of apple silicon are more than worth it.I got the 48gb ram, to help future proof. Also, it'll come in handy for my apps (video editing, 3D modeling/animation). So far, activity monitor reveals low memory/cpu usage.  I also chose the 512gb storage. Yes, I would have liked more storage space, but the Apple premium is expensive. I opted to get thunderbolt 4 & 5 external ssd drives. The thunderbolt 5 ssd drive actually delivers write/read speeds faster than the internal ssd.The space black is not as dark as I expected. However, it does have a serious, elegant appearance. Does it collect dust and fingerprints? Well, I really haven't noticed fingerprints. Yes, if the cover is closed, and it sits for a few days, you'll see some dust. To be fair, it's the same amount that falls on anything else, including a silver MacBook Pro. A simple wipe clears it away. Using a microfiber cloth does a great job for dusting, btw.Even though the 16 inch is large and has a bit of heft, I value the larger screen real estate over a 14 inch screen. The laptop mainly stays at home. So, size and weight is not a major consideration. I do like the form factor for the flexibility for travel. (I was considering getting a Mac mini M4Pro, and a case. But, decided on the MacBook Pro. With the possibility of going Mac Studio M4 variety later in the year.)Overall, very pleased with the MacBook Pro.",14,all,"I've owned this MacBook Pro M4Pro for a few weeks, and very impressed with the power and design.

    Most Reliable Laptops",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2025","So far I have loved the new pro. Screen, touchpad, fingerprint scanner, battery life, and noise of fan are all much better than my mid 2015 model. The sound quality from this laptop is very impressive comparing it to my last. I bought the most powerful version I could without building one with more storage which is more computer than I personally will ever need. I bought the highest end version for my mid 2015 model and it still runs flawlessly today (secondary computer now). I was slightly disappointed that this new computer with greatest M4 processor and upgrades, didn't run any faster than my old version for normal tasks. None-the-less it is a great computer and I love using Apple products. Price is the biggest catch for me buying Apple. With similar features on a Windows computer you can get a lot more bang for the buck. Issue I have always had in Window computers (most expensive versions I could buy) are viruses and constant problems that lead to needing a computer store to fix which is limited in my area. I have never taken either of my last 2 MacBooks to someone for repairs which is insane when they both still run. Hope this one keeps me running for 8-10 years before the next. The biggest issue I have with the the new is the weight of the computer. It is a tank and it thicker than my 2015, but the size are nearly the same but having a 16"" screen instead of 15"". I would have really liked to see a touchscreen version, maybe coming this year unfortunately after I already bought this version.",5,all,"So far I have loved the new pro.

    An Exceptional Blend of Power and Elegance",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2025","The newest MacBook Pro is nothing short of a technological marvel. As a long-time Apple enthusiast, I was eagerly anticipating this release, and it has truly lived up to the hype. From its sleek design to its powerful performance, this laptop is a game-changer for professionals and creatives alike.First and foremost, the display is a standout feature. The Liquid Retina XDR display is stunning, with vibrant colors and incredible brightness that make everything from photo editing to watching movies an immersive experience. The high resolution ensures that even the smallest details are crystal clear, which is essential for graphic designers and video editors. I found myself staring at the screen longer than necessary simply because it was such a pleasure to use.Performance-wise, the new M1 Pro or M1 Max chips are nothing short of revolutionary. The speed and efficiency are remarkable, allowing for seamless multitasking. I can run demanding applications like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Creative Suite without any lag, which has significantly boosted my productivity. The battery life is also impressive; I easily get through a full day of work without needing to recharge, which is a huge plus for those on the go.The keyboard is another highlight. The improved Magic Keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience with excellent key travel, making long writing sessions much more enjoyable. Additionally, the audio quality is outstanding, with rich sound and clear speakers that enhance music and video playback.In terms of connectivity, the return of ports like HDMI and an SD card slot is a welcome addition, catering to the needs of creatives who rely on various peripherals.

If you're lured to these by an Amazon flash offer, and begin to compare other options/offers, be sure to throughly compare the descriptions. Or you'll purchase something you didn't want. If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by ""Deal"" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery.  I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying  different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation.

If you find this out after you set everything up and there is no problem with the computer itself, you're stuck with it. The other issue I had was the inability to exit Win 11 S mode. After hours of trying the standard method and several youtube videos with complex work arounds, I gave up. Today I decided to express my feelings in the MS Edge search window and I received this response from Copilot. (posted in the picture above). I post because subsequent requests produced different results. This work around worked quickly and was a three step fix. Have exited S mode and am happily running Google Chrome. Plus all my Google info and files from my broken laptop ported over. One last note: this is definitely a computer for students. It is priced reasonably considering post Covid greedflation prices. It is comparetively slow and not for use use for gamers. I will keep it as I need a computer for research and writing papers.5/30/2024-My laptop broke. Needed to complete paperwork for a project with tight time lured by ""Deal"" for laptop with 4GB ram 64 storage Bluetooth, Wi-Fi. $169, 12hr delivery. I figure it was good enough to get my work done. At the site several other options were available with the same features and more memory. All had delivery dates of 1=2 days except 1 with 8GB ram, 192GB storage for $259 w/ $40 coupon, Thought extra memory and storage was worth extra $90. Computer arrived. It took an 1-1/2 hr to do updates. When I tried to download Chrome to work in Google docs {state recommended for changes}. This computer is locked into MS S mode blocking download of apps not in MS store. After spending 2hrs trying different S mode exit directions is was resolved to doing the work on my Samsung S20 which took 3 hours to do 1 hr of work. This computer doesn't have Bluetooth, is extremely slow. MS locks y into using Edge in a worse case scenario than they did with Explorer 25 yrs ago. Don't be lured by the free1yr of Home 365. Cannot return because I used it and is technically not broken. HP is obviously returning to the days of cheap low-grade Compaq. Clearest example of Greedflation. It also moved data from broken laptop creating what will be hours of scrubbing to sell at 1/2 price on Ebay.",1

Obviously clicking the undo button in the middle of a writing project could mean clicking undo 75 times before you find the mistake.2. The screen is way too small for a writer because it is long.

    Perfect for our transition to homeschooling",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2024","This is similar to what my daughter was using in school, so it's made the transition to online homeschooling very easy. It's compact and easy to take anywhere. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, which is what we wanted, and the battery lasts a LONG time once charged. It isn't used for much else besides online school and additional web browsing for research or school related activities, but it works great so far. It is fast, responsive, and easy to set up.

    Alright for the price, but has many issues with SD card",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022","[Update 6/26/2022 to lower rating to 1 star]:I have been using this for 13 months now. The Chromebook still  consistentlyrestarts by itself every few days after I close the lid to put it in sleep mode, thus wasting time booting up when I try to continue reading the next day. Chrome OS has forced automatic updates which I didn't think too much of before, but the last 2 updates broke compatibility with the SD card in all apps. This includes Google's official ""Files"" app from the Play store, published by Google themselves, the same company who makes the operating system. This has wasted 4 or 5 frusting hours at night when I want to kick back and relax by reading a bit since I have to debug why I can't get any apps to read from my SD card even though it was working perfectly fine the previous day before the Chromebook restarted by itself and updated itself even though I don't want it to. I am currently trying to debug the SD card not working for the second time this month now and I am just tired of this garbage. If you just want a Chromebook to browse the web, this is good. But try to use it for anything else or try to use an SD card with it, and I do not recommend trying this. Stick with an Android tablet from a good brand or an iPad. It is a shame because the hardware from Acer seems good, but the operating system is just garbage and there is no way I can give this anything higher than 1/5 when it can't even do the most basic of tasks to just open image files from a SD card.[Original review for 3 stars]:I only bought this to mainly use as a tablet for reading. I download a lot of content for offline reading so I use a SD card, but the chromebook seems to have issues when leaving the SD card in it. When I wake it from sleep, it will show a warning saying I shouldn't remove the SD card without safely ejecting it first, but the SD card is still inserted and was never removed (I live alone so noone else would have touched it). No data can be read from the SD card at this point and I have to take it out and put it back in. I thought it was a bad SD card at first and tried another SD card but it had the same issue. After some googling it turns out other people had the same issue. This makes using this chromebook a lot more annoying since I have to remove and reinsert the SD card every time I want to use it.The chromebook also randomly reboots when I open it up, although it happens pretty rarely (maybe once or twice a month). The battery percent is still always higher than 30% after booting up, so it didn't run out of battery. I assume this might be related to leaving the SD card inserted, but I don't want to take out the card since micro SD cards are very easy to lose.Overall using the chromebook is good - things load pretty fast and the touchscreen isn't super responsive but is fine for the price point.

    Wonderful Chromebook, but Manage Expectations Where Apps are Concerned",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2022","I purchased the Acer Chromebook Spin 311 to use as a bedside entertainment center, so I wanted something that could stream and have quality screen resolution.  I liked the idea of a device that I could position with the screen set back (open like a laptop) or set forward (flip it and go triangular, baby!); I also needed a reliable blue tooth as I wear comfy headphones that I can sleep in.  I have an extensive music collection that I keep on an external SSD and I absolutely love MediaMonkey because of it's customizable interface on it's Window's app (I assumed the ChromeOS version would be very similar - my first major stumble).First, the positive:  The device itself is fantastic.  Everything about it feels sturdy, the touchscreen is responsive (though, I will say there are times when I feel I have to hit an app 2 or 3 times to activate).  The screen resolution and sound quality are lovely for a device of this size and price - don't go expecting studio quality here, but the streaming was beautiful.  The visuals are not pixelated; it's as good as watching on a television (only smaller).  Oh, and I will say I love the fact that the USB-C port is on both sides, which makes it easier to plug in on any side (it's the little things).Performance is great, I get no lag and I've had no issues streaming Netflix, Hulu or Disney+.  I just realized I haven't tried watching Twitch or Youtube on this.  I'll download those apps and if I have any problems with them, I'll update this review and let you know.I have one grouse, and it's kind of a biggie:  The apps are terrible.  It was so dismaying at first, I did actually contemplate sending the device back.  I slept on it and decided I was going to stick it out.  In truth, part of my disappointment is that the ChromeOS version of MediaMonkey is disappointing.  When it came down to it, I tried a whole slew of music apps and I wound up settling on the music app that annoyed me the least (VLC).  Most of the apps have ads that are intrusive, and even the ones I thought about paying for just don't seem worth the value.Even simple apps like an alarm clock or a blue tooth manager:  I downloaded several different ones, and I'm continually settling on the app that annoys me the least or seems to be able to handle some of what I would like.  I even tried to find a power button app because I just wanted to turn off the computer with a single, on screen button push - despite over a dozen apps that claimed to do this, all of them performed poorly and one you had to close out an ad before it would turn off (really?!?).In choosing whether or not to keep it, I had to weigh the solid build and reliable performance against an operating system that was under par for Windows or Mac.That said, I'm very glad I kept this little guy.  In the end, it's a reliable little entertainment unit and it's wonderful where it counts: It's a great streamer (with a beautiful picture) and it plays music that I love and I can leave it in place and listen on my blue tooth headphones while I wander all over the house.

    Great ChromeOS 2-in-1",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2020","Much faster and of course newer than my old Acer 15"" Chromebook, which was one of the first 15"" models they made and the only 15"" Chromebook on the market when I bought it. I got this because I wanted something good for couch surfing and my old Chromebook doesn't support Android apps so it was starting to feel very limited in use. I decided on this model after reading a lot of positive reviews, which mainly turned out to be for the last model that uses this devices same name.I'll start off by saying this thing feels really sturdy, built well in typical Acer fashion. But I'm kind of surprised with how big the bezels are, they easily could've put a bigger screen in the thing. The screen that is installed though is plenty bright enough for my use, and is perfectly sharp at a typical viewing distance with good viewing angles. The touchscreen is kind of flaky in my experience, but that could be a problem with the user since some touchscreens just don't like responding well to my fingers. Performance in typical use is perfectly fine, but don't expect to do much gaming as it doesn't have the power to run more intense Android games smoothly. WiFi is very fast and signal is excellent. The ports provided are great, and I love that it can be charged from either USB-C port. The keyboard feels pretty good and the trackpad is about what you'd expect on a device like this.Now where I am truly disappointed is in the fact that stylus support was removed from the last model of this system. I'm a bit of an artist and like to draw on occasion, even if it's just playing a round of Draw Something to fix my itch. I thought drawing on this with an Android app would be pretty nice compared to my Note phone. And another person had already asked if this system supported an active stylus, which Acer responded by saying yes. This thing absolutely does NOT support an active stylus. At least not an EMR one like you find in Samsung devices (S-Pen) or a Wacom stylus. I'm tempted to send this model back and order the older one since there doesn't seem to be much difference between the N3350 and N4020 CPUs.I'll also mention here that the indent for the second camera that goes above the keyboard for use in tablet mode is present, but there isn't a camera. I was unsure what this indent was for until I did some more reading online and found a review for a pre-release version of this system. That included the camera and stylus. Seems they changed their minds on both features but didn't bother to get rid of the indent.Long story short, it's a good little 2-in-1 but some design choices are odd for a device in 2020. Also many of the reviews out there are for the last model (N3350 CPU) or for pre-production test units that have features this thing actually doesn't have (stylus and second camera).

    Love the Convertible Design, but I'm not impressed with the storage",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020","The Acer Chromebook Spin 311 is a huge upgrade from my previous Chromebook and it suits most of my needs. I purchased it because of it's price and convertible design. The limited internal storage space and poor camera are the biggest drawbacks in my opinion. Depending on what you plan to use his for, this might be a great low cost option. There are a lot of other devices out there in this price range though. I think it's important to find out what features matter most to you before you decide.Pros:-Low Cost-Convertible Design (My favorite feature)-Good web browsing performance (haven’t had any issues streaming videos or having multiple tabs open)-Good battery life-Ability to install most of the apps available in the Google Play store.Note: Minecraft is not currently available unless you are planning to use the education edition (in case that’s something you were hoping to play) and some apps are not properly optimized to be used in landscape mode (this seems to be an issue with android apps in general, so I don’t fault this particular device).Cons:-Only 32 GB internal storage. 13.3 gb are used by the system. This doesn’t leave much room for installing apps. Maybe I’m missing something, but I haven’t found a way to move apps to the SD card. So far, I’ve only been able to select the SD card as the storage location for downloads within apps. For example, I can tell the Netflix app that I want to store downloaded videos on the SD card.-Camera quality is extremely poor for video calls. It's dim and grainy. Using extremely bright lighting helps some, but the graininess is still noticeable.-1366x768 Screen Resolution. This isn’t a deal breaker for me, but I do notice the lack of a full HD screen more than I thought I would on a screen this size. This may not be an issue for most users.-Heavy/Bulky in tablet mode. I primarily use this as a laptop with a touchscreen that has a keyboard that I can tuck away for watching videos or playing games. That's what I was looking for, so this works for me. If you are looking for something that is comfortable to use as a tablet, you'd probably be better off getting a 2-in-1 Chromebook with detachable keyboard or a tablet with a keyboard case.Overall, I'm happy with the value and performance of the Acer Chromebook Spin 311.

    Will not stay connected to the internet.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","In 2020, I purchased a Samsung Chromebook. After three years, it stopped updating, and its functionality slowly deteriorated. Some websites won't load, and making purchases is limited to certain sites. During this summer's Prime, I searched for a replacement. The Acer seemed like a reasonable replacement.Within a day of receipt, I had trouble staying connected to my internet. I work from home for a creative agency using a Mac and my partner is a video editor who uses a PC. We have never had issues staying connected on the other three laptops. I searched reviews and Reddit and made some recommended adjustments but nothing worked. I reached out to Acer hoping they would be able to troubleshoot but they needed me to FedEx it to TX. At least they provided a shipping label and the kind folks at FedEx gave me a free box. I arrived overnight and was shipped back to me the same day. Suspiciously fast! The notes on the paper left in the box were a little condescending. It appears they replaced a few parts. I know they didn't have time to really test it! Sure enough about a day into using it and I wouldn't stay connected to the internet. Frustrating! I called Acer again and their solution was to have me ship it back. At that point, I was pretty annoyed. What were they going to do that they didn't do the first time? Shipping it 5X is not cost-effective. Why not just send me a new one??????? Also, I've been without a personal laptop for a few weeks now. So the guy said a supervisor would call me. It took 10 days of phone tag (a different very frustrating story) We spoke on a Tuesday. He said I had to ship it but he'd expedite and make sure I'd get it back by the weekend. It was back in TX for 12 days. So 2 weeks later I got the laptop with an even more condescending note that says they replaced the motherboard. At this point, with parts, shipping, and labor we're way beyond the cost of a new machine! AND I'm well past the window to just return it through Amazon.

    Update in review...Just what I needed, easy to navigated!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2020","Update: after using a few months, there is a common ‘glitch’ watching movies/shows. The Chromebook picture will start to jump/wiggle a bit and then get stuck. (Think old school like a record skipping)I have to hit the power and refresh button to unstick it to reboot. It does this almost daily. Kind of annoying.End of update•••I am not a tech person, and I have never had a laptop before. I broke my leg and ankle and have been bed bound. Also friends want to do zoom and I only have my iPhone which isn’t the best for zoom. I decided I needed a laptop to use as I heal and recover. Not having any experience I had no idea what to get, I knew I wanted something that was also a touchscreen. It had to be easy to use. I did some research and hadn’t planned on getting a chromebook. But I read the reviews for this Acer chromebook and the price was good for my budget. When I got it, I was happy to find that it is easy for me to navigate. I quickly set it up with Netflix and Amazon Prime, the picture quality for watching shows and movies was great. Perfect size for me while I’m stuck recovering in bed and can’t watch tv in the living room. Zoom is so much easier now with this versus my phone screen.

(Think old school like a record skipping)I have to hit the power and refresh button to unstick it to reboot. It does this almost daily. Kind of annoying.End of update•••I am not a tech person, and I have never had a laptop before. I broke my leg and ankle and have been bed bound. Also friends want to do zoom and I only have my iPhone which isn’t the best for zoom. I decided I needed a laptop to use as I heal and recover. Not having any experience I had no idea what to get, I knew I wanted something that was also a touchscreen. It had to be easy to use. I did some research and hadn’t planned on getting a chromebook. But I read the reviews for this Acer chromebook and the price was good for my budget. When I got it, I was happy to find that it is easy for me to navigate. I quickly set it up with Netflix and Amazon Prime, the picture quality for watching shows and movies was great. Perfect size for me while I’m stuck recovering in bed and can’t watch tv in the living room. Zoom is so much easier now with this versus my phone screen.

    Good for web surfing and document editing, but abysmal for streaming",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","We purchased this for our daughter for virtual school during COVID-19.  She already has an iPad , but were told by the school iPads were not allowed and they recommend a Chromebook.  We purchased this one based on reviews and limited supply.The Good:The Acer Spin 311 has good build quality and feels like a solid device.  The hinges have an appropriate level of resistance to keep it from flopping around.  The buttons and keyboard feel really good for a laptop of this price.  The screen resolution, color and brightness were all acceptable.Setting up the Spin 311 was easy and when our daughter logged on with her School Gmail account everything was there.  Google docs, drive, and classroom all worked out of the box.  We tried to print, but our old Canon was not supported, but I attribute that to the very old printer and not the Acer.The Bad:The Acer Spin 311 seems incapable of streaming anything.  On her first day of school after about an hour she complained Zoom kept freezing up.  We have a Netgear Orbi mesh network with strong signal and ISP with 100 up / down.  I checked the WiFi speed / signal strength at her desk and everything checked out.  The only way she could get the Zoom to work was by turning her camera off.  Normally this would have been a disappointment but the camera is such poor quality, no video was probably better than the grainy image we got with it.Later I tried to stream a movie from our home Plex server which was 29Mbps in original format to see if it was maybe the Zoom app or the internet.  The Acer Spin 311 could not get more than 5 minutes in without freezing up.  Having the server trans-code the movie to around 20Mbps I could finally get it to play, but somewhat jittery.  I tried both the Plex web app and native app with the same result.Summary:If you are going to just edit documents and surf the web, the Acer Spin 311 is probably fine, but I have to imagine you can get other Chromebooks for cheaper that can do that just as good.  If you try to video conference the terrible camera image and inability to stream any normal video is a deal breaker.",34,all,"We purchased this for our daughter for virtual school during COVID-19.

    Disappointing Purchase: Mismatched Laptops and Hidden System Information",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025","Review Content:I recently purchased three Acer Gateway Chromebook 311 CBO311-1H-C1MX laptops from Amazon. This purchase has been extremely disappointing due to significant discrepancies and deceptive practices.Firstly, of the three laptops received, only one was a genuine Gateway brand. The other two, despite having the same model number, were clearly different, non-Gateway units. This immediately raised concerns about the accuracy of the product listing.Secondly, and more alarmingly, the battery specifications were inconsistent. The genuine Gateway laptop had a 45-volt battery, while the other two had 30-volt batteries. This difference in power supply is a major red flag, suggesting these are not equivalent products.Adding to the frustration, the sellers had placed labels directly over the system information stickers on the non-Gateway laptops. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the true specifications and brand of these devices. This practice is highly suspicious and dishonest.I am deeply dissatisfied with this purchase.

    Alright for the price, but has many issues with SD card",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022","[Update 6/26/2022 to lower rating to 1 star]:I have been using this for 13 months now. The Chromebook still  consistentlyrestarts by itself every few days after I close the lid to put it in sleep mode, thus wasting time booting up when I try to continue reading the next day. Chrome OS has forced automatic updates which I didn't think too much of before, but the last 2 updates broke compatibility with the SD card in all apps. This includes Google's official ""Files"" app from the Play store, published by Google themselves, the same company who makes the operating system. This has wasted 4 or 5 frusting hours at night when I want to kick back and relax by reading a bit since I have to debug why I can't get any apps to read from my SD card even though it was working perfectly fine the previous day before the Chromebook restarted by itself and updated itself even though I don't want it to. I am currently trying to debug the SD card not working for the second time this month now and I am just tired of this garbage. If you just want a Chromebook to browse the web, this is good. But try to use it for anything else or try to use an SD card with it, and I do not recommend trying this. Stick with an Android tablet from a good brand or an iPad. It is a shame because the hardware from Acer seems good, but the operating system is just garbage and there is no way I can give this anything higher than 1/5 when it can't even do the most basic of tasks to just open image files from a SD card.[Original review for 3 stars]:I only bought this to mainly use as a tablet for reading. I download a lot of content for offline reading so I use a SD card, but the chromebook seems to have issues when leaving the SD card in it. When I wake it from sleep, it will show a warning saying I shouldn't remove the SD card without safely ejecting it first, but the SD card is still inserted and was never removed (I live alone so noone else would have touched it). No data can be read from the SD card at this point and I have to take it out and put it back in. I thought it was a bad SD card at first and tried another SD card but it had the same issue. After some googling it turns out other people had the same issue. This makes using this chromebook a lot more annoying since I have to remove and reinsert the SD card every time I want to use it.The chromebook also randomly reboots when I open it up, although it happens pretty rarely (maybe once or twice a month). The battery percent is still always higher than 30% after booting up, so it didn't run out of battery. I assume this might be related to leaving the SD card inserted, but I don't want to take out the card since micro SD cards are very easy to lose.Overall using the chromebook is good - things load pretty fast and the touchscreen isn't super responsive but is fine for the price point.

    Will not stay connected to the internet.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","In 2020, I purchased a Samsung Chromebook. After three years, it stopped updating, and its functionality slowly deteriorated. Some websites won't load, and making purchases is limited to certain sites. During this summer's Prime, I searched for a replacement. The Acer seemed like a reasonable replacement.Within a day of receipt, I had trouble staying connected to my internet. I work from home for a creative agency using a Mac and my partner is a video editor who uses a PC. We have never had issues staying connected on the other three laptops. I searched reviews and Reddit and made some recommended adjustments but nothing worked. I reached out to Acer hoping they would be able to troubleshoot but they needed me to FedEx it to TX. At least they provided a shipping label and the kind folks at FedEx gave me a free box. I arrived overnight and was shipped back to me the same day. Suspiciously fast! The notes on the paper left in the box were a little condescending. It appears they replaced a few parts. I know they didn't have time to really test it! Sure enough about a day into using it and I wouldn't stay connected to the internet. Frustrating! I called Acer again and their solution was to have me ship it back. At that point, I was pretty annoyed. What were they going to do that they didn't do the first time? Shipping it 5X is not cost-effective. Why not just send me a new one??????? Also, I've been without a personal laptop for a few weeks now. So the guy said a supervisor would call me. It took 10 days of phone tag (a different very frustrating story) We spoke on a Tuesday. He said I had to ship it but he'd expedite and make sure I'd get it back by the weekend. It was back in TX for 12 days. So 2 weeks later I got the laptop with an even more condescending note that says they replaced the motherboard. At this point, with parts, shipping, and labor we're way beyond the cost of a new machine! AND I'm well past the window to just return it through Amazon. So now I'm stuck with this laptop that WILL NOT stay connected to the internet. I will be in the middle of something and have to reboot. And BTW Acer didn't follow up once to see how it's going.

    Good for web surfing and document editing, but abysmal for streaming",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","We purchased this for our daughter for virtual school during COVID-19.  She already has an iPad , but were told by the school iPads were not allowed and they recommend a Chromebook.  We purchased this one based on reviews and limited supply.The Good:The Acer Spin 311 has good build quality and feels like a solid device.  The hinges have an appropriate level of resistance to keep it from flopping around.  The buttons and keyboard feel really good for a laptop of this price.  The screen resolution, color and brightness were all acceptable.Setting up the Spin 311 was easy and when our daughter logged on with her School Gmail account everything was there.  Google docs, drive, and classroom all worked out of the box.  We tried to print, but our old Canon was not supported, but I attribute that to the very old printer and not the Acer.The Bad:The Acer Spin 311 seems incapable of streaming anything.  On her first day of school after about an hour she complained Zoom kept freezing up.  We have a Netgear Orbi mesh network with strong signal and ISP with 100 up / down.  I checked the WiFi speed / signal strength at her desk and everything checked out.  The only way she could get the Zoom to work was by turning her camera off.  Normally this would have been a disappointment but the camera is such poor quality, no video was probably better than the grainy image we got with it.Later I tried to stream a movie from our home Plex server which was 29Mbps in original format to see if it was maybe the Zoom app or the internet.  The Acer Spin 311 could not get more than 5 minutes in without freezing up.  Having the server trans-code the movie to around 20Mbps I could finally get it to play, but somewhat jittery.  I tried both the Plex web app and native app with the same result.Summary:If you are going to just edit documents and surf the web, the Acer Spin 311 is probably fine, but I have to imagine you can get other Chromebooks for cheaper that can do that just as good.  If you try to video conference the terrible camera image and inability to stream any normal video is a deal breaker.",34,critical,"We purchased this for our daughter for virtual school during COVID-19.

    Disappointing Purchase: Mismatched Laptops and Hidden System Information",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2025","Review Content:I recently purchased three Acer Gateway Chromebook 311 CBO311-1H-C1MX laptops from Amazon. This purchase has been extremely disappointing due to significant discrepancies and deceptive practices.Firstly, of the three laptops received, only one was a genuine Gateway brand. The other two, despite having the same model number, were clearly different, non-Gateway units. This immediately raised concerns about the accuracy of the product listing.Secondly, and more alarmingly, the battery specifications were inconsistent. The genuine Gateway laptop had a 45-volt battery, while the other two had 30-volt batteries. This difference in power supply is a major red flag, suggesting these are not equivalent products.Adding to the frustration, the sellers had placed labels directly over the system information stickers on the non-Gateway laptops. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the true specifications and brand of these devices. This practice is highly suspicious and dishonest.I am deeply dissatisfied with this purchase.

I don't know why. I didn't send it in to be repaired, and didn't do anything to try and fix it myself. It is working fine now.",0

    Good value, but watch for damage and who you buy from!",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2025","Good value. I purchased this model: (HP 255 G10 Laptop, Ryzen 3 7330U, 15.6"", 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD with Windows 11 Pro) from the seller Chromebook Prosale via Amazon for $399 in December of 2024.I had to return the first one because it had a RAM error. Every other time I started it, the Caps Lock LED would blink (3 long and two short). According to the documentation, that meant a RAM issue. Might have just needed a cleaning or the RAM was installed improperly. (more on that later.) I'll never know because I didn't want to void the warranty. So I sent it back and the seller promptly sent a new one. No errors on that one. YAY!Booted it up and it indeed had no errors, recognized all hardware, and had Windows 11 Pro installed. All good. Pretty quick. WiFi has typical range. There are two USB ports, one HDMI port, and one 1/8"" audio jack. Battery holds a charge like a champ. No security port. However, I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop.Being satisfied, I then voided the warranty and opened the system to take a look. (I don't recommend this for the casual user because, though I'm not sure, I think it will void your warranty - if they find out that is!)Now the interesting part:TLDR: Be careful when buying from third-party sellers. You might save money, but you never know where the laptop has been or whose grubby paws were inside it!See attached image of the RAM. Note that only one stick is covered with a sticker. This leads me to believe that HP built this laptop with 8 GB of RAM (1 stick) originally. I can't prove it, but I think that the seller (or another intermediary) installed the 2nd stick of RAM to bring it up to 16 GB. Three clues led me to this deduction (which is guesswork): 1 - the lack of a sticker. That's weak sauce, and HP QA would probably not let that pass before leaving the manufacturer. 2. One of the panel's front corners was slightly lifted off two of the clips, as if the person who closed the panel (after installing the RAM) didn't finish the job properly. Made it easier for me to pop the panel though! 3. The first laptop I received had that RAM issue I mentioned. That would probably not pass QA at an HP manufacturing plant either. Standard procedure is to have a system booted at least three times.Am I happy with my assumption? No. But I'll deal with it after inspecting the RAM installed and comparing it with the first 8 GB stick.

    Perfect for college",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024","Love it! Bought for college. My old 2013 MacBook Air is out of commission so I needed something cheap but reliable. So far so good! It’s definitely made of some kind of carbon/plastic material which was unexpected - I thought it would be metal. Sometimes my screen will flicker when I hold it with one hand when walking. I think the weakness of the material mixed with how big it is, makes it warp a smidge when held from one of the corners. Otherwise it has been great. I do wish I had paid attention when seeing reviews about the keyboard backlights. It is really hard to work in the dark due to the keys just going pitch black.

It’s easy to set up which is great. Also, you don’t have to set up the Microsoft office/word/excell etc… It tries to make it seem like you have to, but why pay for it yearly when you can purchase it one time on Amazon, install, and never have to pay for it again? The speed is decent, not terrible, but also nothing to write home about which is expected for a computer at this basic level. I have had to deal with freezing once so far, but other than that it doesn’t seem to freeze up. The screen is just okay. Nothing is super clean on on video calls people look grainy and so do I. The trick is to sit in natural light which seems to give the best image.

    Terrible battery, poor speakers",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2025","Got this for my mom to replace her computer and give her some portability.

    Not a good value if over $250 although it's cheap.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2025","Received a laptop that was open box but got a good deal, so I kept it.  Computer works well but not very powerful.  It won't run any type of video game whatsoever.  It couldn't handle Microsoft X simulator at any level.  It does however function as a basic laptop.  The 32 megs of ram and 1 tb hard drive make it run as well as it possibly can; it would be a slug if it had any less.  Overall, it's basic, as basic as you'd want.

    Medium-high performance, monstrously loud",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024","Performance seems to be about as good as you could hope for from a ""value-buy"" Gaming laptop. Weight is manageable, if a little on the heavier side, and the build quality is decisively solid. I am able to play the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at high near optimal settings, but there is not enough V-Ram to use the Ultra-High Resolution textures (as indicated by the game itself when trying to switch the settings up from the default detected by the game at ""only"" High).The overall experience is exceptionally smooth and after an hour of play the internal CPU temperature and GPU temperatures were stable at 70c. I tested both sitting on a flat, plain desktop and elevated on a tilted-mesh platform for an hour each and was very pleased to see this result.The only reason I can't give 5 full stars for this device is the cooling fans are absurdly loud, easily above 60dB. Please consider your use cases and intentions for this device as you will not be able to quietly play on the couch along others without disturbing their experience. Over-ear headphones and privacy recommended during use.I have not tried any modifications yet, but there should be room for higher RAM should you elect to purchase separate cards to install with two DDR5 slots available. Ease of access to these slots and the NVMe slot appears to be normal for such a device, will need plastic spudgers to release lower covering without damaging the frame.Base-model on offer from Acer site only has 8gbs installed and an i5 processer by default.

I am able to play the recently released Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 at high near optimal settings, but there is not enough V-Ram to use the Ultra-High Resolution textures (as indicated by the game itself when trying to switch the settings up from the default detected by the game at ""only"" High).The overall experience is exceptionally smooth and after an hour of play the internal CPU temperature and GPU temperatures were stable at 70c. I tested both sitting on a flat, plain desktop and elevated on a tilted-mesh platform for an hour each and was very pleased to see this result.The only reason I can't give 5 full stars for this device is the cooling fans are absurdly loud, easily above 60dB. Please consider your use cases and intentions for this device as you will not be able to quietly play on the couch along others without disturbing their experience. Over-ear headphones and privacy recommended during use.I have not tried any modifications yet, but there should be room for higher RAM should you elect to purchase separate cards to install with two DDR5 slots available. Ease of access to these slots and the NVMe slot appears to be normal for such a device, will need plastic spudgers to release lower covering without damaging the frame.Base-model on offer from Acer site only has 8gbs installed and an i5 processer by default.

    Perfect Deal",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2025","I’m very well-versed with the computer industry and products there in, I have done extensive research trying to find the perfect laptop for my daughter at a great bargain. There’s always a phenomenal deal out there, although they are rare to come by and this is one of those. When I say I got this from my daughter, I don’t mean to downplay it at all because I would get it for myself, although I have a high-performance laptop already, which I also got a phenomenal bargain on. This laptops processor is incredible as is the graphics card. These two together really offer a very high-end laptop. This is a brand new laptop and for the price of these products, I’m just blown away because if you do your research, you’ll see that this is easily about 25% below market value for all the specs in this laptop. I would suggest only one thing as mandatory and that’s buying a micro USB memory stick because this has 512 GB. You can buy a 1TB cheap. I might, at some point increase the ram up to 32 GB for her, but that is not necessary at all as 16 GB that it comes with is perfect. But just because I’m saying that I’m gonna do these very minor add-ons does not mean you need to do anything to this laptop at all because it is 100% perfect as it is.You have to be very careful when buying laptops online because some are way overpriced and they mix the hardware up to where you might have a good processor but a real crappy graphics card or vice versa. This laptop is perfect. I give it a 10 out of 10 for its incredible bargain. If you want a great laptop that offers you some of the top tier hardware for a mid tier pricing and this is perfect for you I mean, who wouldn’t want that. I’m not sure how they can offer such phenomenal deals because the rest of the market would have this laptop easily between $1000 on average up to $1200 on the high side. Laptop is priced at $799 currently and it’s brand new not refurbished, which is just amazing.I searched for 2.5 months to find the perfect laptop and this was it.I will definitely edit this through time if anything pops up with issues or anything.

    Ok laptop, but with too many little issues",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025","The laptop is okay. While you can hear the fan, it's not nearly as loud or bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be. That being said, here are the reasons I'm not keeping this laptop.

So, if you want to use the F buttons, and then change it so that you can use the volume or brightness buttons, without holding down the Fn button, you can't simply switch between which one works w/out holding down the Fn button. You have to go into the bios and set it one way or another.2. No ability for facial login. What? In this day and age, it can't login or do passwords with the camera? Dumb.3. It's not nearly as fast and snappy as comparable laptops with the same specs. There's actually quite a bit of lag when you click to open or install a new program. I mean, a pretty good lag.4.

I love my surface laptop, in which the vent is in the hinge between the monitor and the body.5. Only 1 USB-C port. Really?Anyway, not a bad price or terrible laptop, it just has too many little things that add up to a less than ideal user experience. Oh, and I really wish they would get rid of the standard power plugin to the laptop. It's the typical little round jack that you push into the laptop power port.

    Acer Nitro V15 Gaming Laptop - 7 months later!",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025","Hey everyone! I’ve owned this laptop for about 7 months, so let me give you my honest review on this product.This product has been with me since I turned 14, and I love it! It used to have amazing performance, easy to setup, and overall really high quality.However, with its positives, there are a couple negatives I would like to point out. First, it comes out of the box on balanced mode, meaning you will get steady FPS while keeping your fans quiet. But, after about 3 months, I noticed that the fans were starting to get way louder as I was using it. It kept my family up, and it was starting to become worse. I have tried Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant and Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and I can easily confirm that it is slower than when out of the box. Since I’ve owned it for 7 months, the health on the battery health started to get extremely worse. I am currently 7 months later seeing anywhere from 100-170 FPS in each of these games, which is not as good as it used to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I shared my experience with this. I hope you guys enjoy this laptop just as much as I did, but if you are looking at a higher budget, try looking into box-like gaming PCs.

It may not be Alienware but it is cheaper. It does get warm but I had a Toshiba that use to get very hot and this is just warm. Quick startup and clear video. It weighs as much as a laptop that should have all the drives and such but that's fine. I don't game as much as I data transfer  and I love the quickness this has.

My Littles love looking at the keys when they light up. I love my online game and thus far have had no issues with this game. Speed and performance are rocking. The battery life is good enough to where I don't spend all day play. This system is very slim and the weight and balance is well put into it. The appearance is sleek and the cost for this system is well worth it. Super recommended for PC gamers and beginners.",13,all,The media could not be loaded.

    Acer Nitro V15 Gaming Laptop - 7 months later!",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2025","Hey everyone! I’ve owned this laptop for about 7 months, so let me give you my honest review on this product.This product has been with me since I turned 14, and I love it! It used to have amazing performance, easy to setup, and overall really high quality.However, with its positives, there are a couple negatives I would like to point out. First, it comes out of the box on balanced mode, meaning you will get steady FPS while keeping your fans quiet. But, after about 3 months, I noticed that the fans were starting to get way louder as I was using it. It kept my family up, and it was starting to become worse. I have tried Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant and Call of Duty Black Ops 6, and I can easily confirm that it is slower than when out of the box. Since I’ve owned it for 7 months, the health on the battery health started to get extremely worse. I am currently 7 months later seeing anywhere from 100-170 FPS in each of these games, which is not as good as it used to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I shared my experience with this. I hope you guys enjoy this laptop just as much as I did, but if you are looking at a higher budget, try looking into box-like gaming PCs. It is overall better on performance, and has lower latency, faster WiFi speeds, and is just overall better.Take care everyone 👍",10,critical,"Hey everyone!

Since I’ve owned it for 7 months, the health on the battery health started to get extremely worse. I am currently 7 months later seeing anywhere from 100-170 FPS in each of these games, which is not as good as it used to be.Thank you for taking the time to read this, as I shared my experience with this. I hope you guys enjoy this laptop just as much as I did, but if you are looking at a higher budget, try looking into box-like gaming PCs. It is overall better on performance, and has lower latency, faster WiFi speeds, and is just overall better.Take care everyone 👍",0

    THE ACER NITRO 5 IS A BAD OPTION FOR A LAPTOP.",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2024","The Acer Nitro 5 has gained a reputation for being an entry-level gaming laptop, but upon closer inspection, it quickly becomes apparent that this machine is riddled with major flaws. One of the most glaring issues is its processors, which, while advertised as being capable of handling gaming and intensive tasks, are far from adequate in delivering a smooth, enjoyable experience. Many users report frequent stuttering, lag, and overheating during gaming sessions, all of which stem from poor CPU performance. Whether it's an Intel or AMD variant, the Nitro 5's processors are often underpowered for the games and applications it's supposed to support. This means that even mid-tier games can feel choppy, forcing users to turn down settings just to avoid thermal throttling, which is caused by the machine’s inability to manage heat properly.In addition to weak processors, the overall build quality of the Acer Nitro 5 is equally disheartening. The laptop feels cheap and plasticky, with creaky hinges and a chassis that flexes under the slightest pressure. This lack of durability makes the laptop feel like it's ready to break at any moment, especially when carried around or used on the go. This low-quality construction is far from what anyone should expect in a laptop, let alone one marketed as a gaming machine. The keyboard and trackpad, essential components for any user, feel flimsy and unresponsive, adding to the frustration when trying to use the device for extended periods. It's clear that Acer cut corners when designing the Nitro 5, favoring flashy RGB lights and aggressive marketing over a well-built, reliable device.One of the most critical issues with the Nitro 5 is its abysmal ventilation system. The laptop's cooling solution is so inadequate that it feels like a joke to anyone who tries to run anything remotely intensive. The fans are loud, constantly spinning up to their maximum RPMs, and yet, they fail to keep the internal components cool. The laptop heats up significantly during gaming sessions or any heavy workload, and the heat is not properly dissipated, leading to uncomfortable use and thermal throttling. Acer even goes as far as to recommend that users elevate the laptop at least 6 inches off the surface to achieve ""proper ventilation."" This is a ridiculous requirement for a supposedly portable device, and it underlines just how poor the laptop's design really is. Instead of investing in a better cooling system, Acer expects users to buy external cooling pads or stands just to keep their laptop functioning at a basic level.Battery life is another major downfall of the Acer Nitro 5. Despite being marketed as a gaming laptop, the battery life is nothing short of abysmal. Many users report that the laptop barely lasts more than two hours on a full charge when performing basic tasks like browsing the web or watching videos. When gaming or doing anything demanding, that time plummets even further, making it impossible to use the laptop away from an outlet for any significant period. This lack of battery performance makes the Nitro 5 a terrible choice for anyone who needs a laptop that can function for long periods without being tethered to a power source. It might as well be a desktop with how reliant it is on constant charging, which completely defeats the purpose of having a portable device.The Nitro 5 also suffers from a frustrating lack of connectivity options, especially when it comes to USB ports. For a gaming laptop, users expect plenty of options to plug in peripherals like external hard drives, mice, keyboards, and gaming controllers. Unfortunately, the Nitro 5 is sorely lacking in this department. It only offers a handful of USB ports, which is nowhere near enough for the average gamer or professional who needs to connect multiple devices simultaneously. This limitation forces users to either invest in a USB hub or constantly swap devices, which is both inconvenient and unnecessary on a modern laptop. For a device meant to handle a wide range of tasks, this is another glaring oversight that adds to the long list of reasons why the Acer Nitro 5 falls short of expectations.The weight of the Nitro 5 also makes it impractical as a portable device. Weighing in at nearly 5.5 pounds, this laptop feels more like a brick than a sleek, portable machine. Its bulky design and heavy weight make it a chore to carry around, especially for anyone who needs to travel with their laptop frequently. Whether you’re commuting, going to class, or even just moving it around the house, the Nitro 5’s heft makes it clear that it's better suited as a desktop replacement rather than a true laptop. The idea of portability is completely lost when you consider how heavy and awkward the Nitro 5 is to move, making it more of a stationary device that you’ll want to keep on your desk at all times.Compounding these issues is the fact that, even when set up properly as a desktop replacement, the Nitro 5’s performance is underwhelming. Despite its heavy weight, loud fans, and elevated placement for ""proper ventilation,"" the device still struggles with heat management and performance under load. It’s ironic that, despite all the sacrifices in portability, the Nitro 5 still fails to deliver on the one thing it’s supposed to do: provide a solid gaming and multitasking experience. Even when plugged in and stationary, the laptop cannot escape its poor design choices, further emphasizing that it’s simply not worth the investment. This makes the Nitro 5 a terrible choice for those looking for a gaming laptop that can perform well both on the go and at home.To summarize, the Acer Nitro 5 is a deeply flawed laptop that fails to live up to the expectations set by its marketing. Its processors are underpowered, leading to a poor user experience in both gaming and productivity tasks. The build quality is low, with flimsy materials and a cheap feel that detracts from the overall usability of the device. The ventilation is so bad that users are forced to elevate the laptop off the surface just to prevent it from overheating, and the battery life is laughably short. The lack of sufficient USB ports makes it difficult to use with the peripherals most users would need, and the heavy weight makes it more suitable as a desktop than a true portable laptop. For anyone considering the Acer Nitro 5, it's clear that there are far better options available that won't leave you frustrated with the numerous compromises this machine demands.PS. this was written on an acer nitro 5.",5,critical,"The Acer Nitro 5 has gained a reputation for being an entry-level gaming laptop, but upon closer inspection, it quickly becomes apparent that this machine is riddled with major flaws. One of the most glaring issues is its processors, which, while advertised as being capable of handling gaming and intensive tasks, are far from adequate in delivering a smooth, enjoyable experience. Many users report frequent stuttering, lag, and overheating during gaming sessions, all of which stem from poor CPU performance. Whether it's an Intel or AMD variant, the Nitro 5's processors are often underpowered for the games and applications it's supposed to support. This means that even mid-tier games can feel choppy, forcing users to turn down settings just to avoid thermal throttling, which is caused by the machine’s inability to manage heat properly.In addition to weak processors, the overall build quality of the Acer Nitro 5 is equally disheartening. The laptop feels cheap and plasticky, with creaky hinges and a chassis that flexes under the slightest pressure. This lack of durability makes the laptop feel like it's ready to break at any moment, especially when carried around or used on the go. This low-quality construction is far from what anyone should expect in a laptop, let alone one marketed as a gaming machine. The keyboard and trackpad, essential components for any user, feel flimsy and unresponsive, adding to the frustration when trying to use the device for extended periods. It's clear that Acer cut corners when designing the Nitro 5, favoring flashy RGB lights and aggressive marketing over a well-built, reliable device.One of the most critical issues with the Nitro 5 is its abysmal ventilation system. The laptop's cooling solution is so inadequate that it feels like a joke to anyone who tries to run anything remotely intensive. The fans are loud, constantly spinning up to their maximum RPMs, and yet, they fail to keep the internal components cool. The laptop heats up significantly during gaming sessions or any heavy workload, and the heat is not properly dissipated, leading to uncomfortable use and thermal throttling. Acer even goes as far as to recommend that users elevate the laptop at least 6 inches off the surface to achieve ""proper ventilation.""

    Over loaded - Under performed!",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2025","First, I am no computer geek techy; just a hardcore computer enthusiast with above average knowledge of computers.  I made this HP Laptop purchase after extensive research and comparison. I have a Dell Inspiron and was very pleased with it's performance. However, the outdated 7200 rpm hard drive over heated too many times and finally crashed.  I was able to clone most of the data to a new SSD drive; and upgraded the RAM to 16 GBs and the Dell kept marching along. Now, I find the Dell to lag, slows down when using multiple programs, and freezes at the most inopportune times (I use it for djing). So, I decided to purchase a new computer during the holiday ""savings"" period.  Again, after a lot of research, reviewing, waiting, comparing, and hoping, I finally purchased this HP laptop. It boasted a ""high octane"" bundle of components that would make computing ""fast and furious"". I have not witnessed that yet.  I find the WIndows 11 platform to be non-user friendly, non-ergodynamic, and error ridden. The HP seems to constantly search for something before loading web browsers, programs, and commands. This is frustrating because the HP has the 12th gen i7 chip, 32 GB of RAM and a host of other high speed components that don't seem to be working in sync with each others.  Is this HP a great value?  The short answer is Yes! However, buyer beware that cheap prices often come with a cheap build with discount internal hardware components that take longer to work with each other causing frustration and anxiety. Next time, I think I will buy directly from manufacturer and ensure they use proprietary components that are compatible.",5,all,"First, I am no computer geek techy; just a hardcore computer enthusiast with above average knowledge of computers.

I made this HP Laptop purchase after extensive research and comparison. I have a Dell Inspiron and was very pleased with it's performance.

I was able to clone most of the data to a new SSD drive; and upgraded the RAM to 16 GBs and the Dell kept marching along. Now, I find the Dell to lag, slows down when using multiple programs, and freezes at the most inopportune times (I use it for djing).

I returned to PC Online. They charged a restock fee of $85 after they misrepresented the product on Amazon. My requests for FULL refund have yielded no response and I have been waiting for weeks.

    Very Chromebook-y!",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2024","This Chromebook works well.  It runs YouTube videos at 1080p or 1440p perfectly smooth.  It can have an infrequent stutter if you try to run the video at 4K, however the screen is only capable of displaying 1080p.  If it's a slower motion video, you might notice a bit smoother motion than at 1080p but it's tough to pick out if you don't know what to look for.  Otherwise, it functions just as well as the previous 4 different models of Chromebook I've owned (Lenovo, Asus, 2 Acers).  There are 2 things that caused me to not rate it 5 stars:  1) No HDMI out capability.  I wasn't aware that anyone still made a laptop/Chromebook model in 2024 that does not have an HDMI port or capability to output HDMI video thru a USB-C port.  If you don't need HDMI/video out then this shouldn't be an issue.  2) Occasionally, if it sits with the lid open long enough, the sound output stops whether or not you have headphones plugged in.  The only way I've found to re-enable sound is to reboot it (reload button + power button).  Not a big deal since Chrome will ask if you want to re-open up all your tabs and apps.  But still kind of annoying.",1,all,"This Chromebook works well. It runs YouTube videos at 1080p or 1440p perfectly smooth.

    Large display, but Color and Speakers just ok",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2022","I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive.

    A mess",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","I ordered one and the entire two bottom rows of keys stuck, would click like there was sand under the keyboard, or wouldn’t pop back up so my sentence looked like this“Mmmmmmmmy nnnnew laptop  Is unnnnnnnnusabbble”So I reached out to Amazon support who processed a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was also unusable because the charging port would not hold the charger in it. So unless I wanted to sit there and hold the charger for 2 hours to charge it I had to return that one too. So I reached out to support again and processed that return.I ordered a third one hoping the third time would be the charm but alas, it was not. This one has a battery life of about 18 minutes from full charge until it’s dead. I understand these are refurbished but I have some major concerns about quality control at this point as it doesn’t seem like random bad luck that I’d get 3 laptops with major problems.Also adding that these are listed in excellent condition however there are also significant cosmetic issues as well. Scratches, deep dents, bent corners. Not something I’d look at and say “yeah this is in excellent condition”. I hope the seller takes more care in refurbishing these in the future because it feels like they are just out here taking in a computer, restoring it to factory settings and listing it for sale. No way they could do even a cursory check of these and not notice 20 sticky keys or the inability to charge a computer.This process has taken me about 3 weeks from placing my first order and has been a headache all around. I wouldn’t recommend these unless you are fully aware that you’ll need to dedicate time and money to making the computer you receive able to be used.",167,all,"I ordered one and the entire two bottom rows of keys stuck, would click like there was sand under the keyboard, or wouldn’t pop back up so my sentence looked like this“Mmmmmmmmy nnnnew laptop Is unnnnnnnnusabbble”So I reached out to Amazon support who processed a replacement.

    Decent for its price, good for a refurbished product",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024","Got this yesterday in excellent condition. Was on the latest compatible version of macOS with this specific MacBook (Monterey) and so far the performance on this thing is pretty smooth. I saw other reviews from customers complaining about it not working and having major functionality-related issues (it is a refurbished product, after all) so I was sort of skeptical and reminded myself not to be surprised if I encountered issues with this thing out of the box, but I’ll have to say, I was pretty surprised seeing this thing work so smoothly off the bat. It handles web-browsing and other basic tasks pretty well, it hasn’t had any issues with freezing, the battery life isn’t that bad, and it hasn’t had any overheating issues so far. The speaker is decent; it’s pretty loud and clear, even when muffled (I’ve used this on a bed). The only complaint I have is an issue with some of the keys not fully pressing down (in this case being the ‘X’ key), but this doesn’t majorly affect the functionality of the computer. Important to note that this doesn’t come with a touch screen, so if you are the type of person who would benefit from a touch screen, this may not be the best option for you. Speaking of the screen; it’s not the best quality, as it will look burned/blacked out from perspectives other than when directly looking at the screen. Generally, this MacBook provides what it is priced for, and I would say that this model would be best fit for casual users who don’t have demand for high-performance, detail-oriented tasks like gaming and video editing.",14,all,"Got this yesterday in excellent condition.

    Value for money",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","I recently bought a renewed 2017 Apple MacBook Air with a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD storage, and it’s been a pretty decent product. For everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and using apps, it runs smoothly. The 128GB storage is a bit small if you have a lot of files, but the fast SSD helps with quick boot times and file access. The build quality is great, as you’d expect from Apple, with a sturdy aluminum body and a bright 13-inch screen. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive. The battery life is another great feature, lasting a long time on a single charge.As a renewed model, this MacBook Air is a great deal. It’s a cost-effective way to get a reliable Apple laptop without spending a fortune. It’s not the most powerful laptop out there, but for general use and for what I’m using it for on the day to day, it’s enough. Additionally, the slim and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around. If you don’t need a ton of storage, this 2017 MacBook Air is a solid choice that’s easily portable with good performance and decent battery life. My only wish is that the screen quality was a little better.

It’s fast, the battery lasts a long time before needing a charge, the screen quality is amazing, there’s no heat as it charges.It was packaged like a new product with a product manual and a charger. The packing was incredibly protective. I couldn’t be more happier with it! I would absolutely recommend this product.",1

    Dirty, Damaged, Deceptive",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","For reference, I ordered the ACCEPTABLE condition for $230.The bad: computer came dirty on the outside, on the keyboard, on the screen. It is supposed to be cleaned, but the seller did not clean this item at all. It also has case “stickers” to make it look in better condition than it is. I had to remove the sticker on the bottom to see the model information, and I wish I didn’t because the case is severely scratched. I left the sticker on the top. I’m that annoying person that notices every little detail, but an unsuspecting person might not even notice there was a sticker on the outside for a long time. The corner is dented pretty significantly from a drop. The hinge seems a little loose and probably should have been tightened. It looks like there are a few dead pixels (pic w my pointer finger) and the screen actually has a lot of scratches, but when it’s on it’s not distracting.The good: after spending a couple hours tooling around YouTube, I have confirmed that functionally, this computer is the MQD32LL/A model 1466 EMC3178. It seems to function as it should. I’m updating to Monterey (came with Catalina OS installed). Will test camera and microphone tomorrow. Did check the battery life and it’s cycling at 477. New for this computer is 1000, so I think the battery is at about half its life.Overall: I think the quality will likely depend on which Amazon “certified refurbished seller” fulfills your order. Mine was fulfilled by SupremeDealsCR. I don’t think you get to choose who fulfills it, but it does say who the seller is when you add the item to your cart. I called Amazon and they were very helpful and the rep truly did stand behind me as the purchaser, which was such a blessing in something that could have been a headache.",8,all,"For reference, I ordered the ACCEPTABLE condition for $230.The bad: computer came dirty on the outside, on the keyboard, on the screen.

    A mess",1.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2024","I ordered one and the entire two bottom rows of keys stuck, would click like there was sand under the keyboard, or wouldn’t pop back up so my sentence looked like this“Mmmmmmmmy nnnnew laptop  Is unnnnnnnnusabbble”So I reached out to Amazon support who processed a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement was also unusable because the charging port would not hold the charger in it. So unless I wanted to sit there and hold the charger for 2 hours to charge it I had to return that one too. So I reached out to support again and processed that return.I ordered a third one hoping the third time would be the charm but alas, it was not. This one has a battery life of about 18 minutes from full charge until it’s dead. I understand these are refurbished but I have some major concerns about quality control at this point as it doesn’t seem like random bad luck that I’d get 3 laptops with major problems.Also adding that these are listed in excellent condition however there are also significant cosmetic issues as well. Scratches, deep dents, bent corners. Not something I’d look at and say “yeah this is in excellent condition”. I hope the seller takes more care in refurbishing these in the future because it feels like they are just out here taking in a computer, restoring it to factory settings and listing it for sale. No way they could do even a cursory check of these and not notice 20 sticky keys or the inability to charge a computer.This process has taken me about 3 weeks from placing my first order and has been a headache all around.

    Dirty, Damaged, Deceptive",2.0,"Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2023","For reference, I ordered the ACCEPTABLE condition for $230.The bad: computer came dirty on the outside, on the keyboard, on the screen. It is supposed to be cleaned, but the seller did not clean this item at all. It also has case “stickers” to make it look in better condition than it is. I had to remove the sticker on the bottom to see the model information, and I wish I didn’t because the case is severely scratched. I left the sticker on the top. I’m that annoying person that notices every little detail, but an unsuspecting person might not even notice there was a sticker on the outside for a long time. The corner is dented pretty significantly from a drop. The hinge seems a little loose and probably should have been tightened. It looks like there are a few dead pixels (pic w my pointer finger) and the screen actually has a lot of scratches, but when it’s on it’s not distracting.The good: after spending a couple hours tooling around YouTube, I have confirmed that functionally, this computer is the MQD32LL/A model 1466 EMC3178. It seems to function as it should. I’m updating to Monterey (came with Catalina OS installed). Will test camera and microphone tomorrow. Did check the battery life and it’s cycling at 477. New for this computer is 1000, so I think the battery is at about half its life.Overall: I think the quality will likely depend on which Amazon “certified refurbished seller” fulfills your order. Mine was fulfilled by SupremeDealsCR. I don’t think you get to choose who fulfills it, but it does say who the seller is when you add the item to your cart. I called Amazon and they were very helpful and the rep truly did stand behind me as the purchaser, which was such a blessing in something that could have been a headache.",8,critical,"For reference, I ordered the ACCEPTABLE condition for $230.The bad: computer came dirty on the outside, on the keyboard, on the screen.

    How sensitive the screen is",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2025","I did not realize how sensitive the screen is. Maybe it is noted in the guide but I missed it somehow.

I thought that possible there was a protective film covering the screen. Nope. I’m not happy with that aspect. I’d say this is a bad design flaw. When the laptop is in use, you cannot see the markings. Thankfully. They do not distract from my work. Hopefully, they never will. I use this laptop solely for writing.

    My First Apple Laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024","I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer. It didn't take me long to learn to scroll in the other direction than a Windows computer. I am enjoying three free months of Apple TV, so I finally got to see The Tragedy of Macbeth by Joel Coen starring Denzel Washington. The movie looks visually stunning on the I Mac Air 15 screen. The keyboard is pleasant to type on, and it did not take me long at all to adjust to the Mac Air features, (but I already have an I Phone). You do not have to take the tutorial before you can set up the computer as they advise. Avoid doing that as it does not work properly, is confusing, and unnecessary. Also, they say not to shut the Mac Air down, and I heeded their advice, but I found I had to shut it down once and sign in again because Apple TV stopped working. That fixed the problem. Owners who say they can't get the touch ID to work are probably continually shutting down the computer. When you shut down, you will need to sign in again with your password.  Had I waited, I could have gotten it $65.00 cheaper, but I'm glad I have it all set up and can use it to finish my work for the semester.",1,all,"I am enjoying typing, browsing, and completing my work on this computer.

    Not bad, or great.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025",It’s hard not to like the Apple laptops but I am not thrilled about my MacBook. The fact that touchscreen is not standard is mindnumbing. It’s a hallmark of their products and even cheaper computers have them so not sure why Apple skimped here.

On top of that I may be an anomaly but I don’t like how quickly and by default it connects all of my Apple devices onto my Mac.

The fact that touchscreen is not standard is mindnumbing. It’s a hallmark of their products and even cheaper computers have them so not sure why Apple skimped here. I also noticed how finicky it is with some of the Microsoft office apps. Programs like OneNote gets stuck a lot and saving to OneDrive through the Mac is not intuitive or stable. On top of that I may be an anomaly but I don’t like how quickly and by default it connects all of my Apple devices onto my Mac.

    Not bad, or great.",3.0,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2025",It’s hard not to like the Apple laptops but I am not thrilled about my MacBook. The fact that touchscreen is not standard is mindnumbing. It’s a hallmark of their products and even cheaper computers have them so not sure why Apple skimped here. I also noticed how finicky it is with some of the Microsoft office apps. Programs like OneNote gets stuck a lot and saving to OneDrive through the Mac is not intuitive or stable.  On top of that I may be an anomaly but I don’t like how quickly and by default it connects all of my Apple devices onto my Mac. I am in a family of apple/Mac users but I use my computer for school and work. So I don’t want it sync with my own devices e much less anyone else’s.

Apple iOS is never equivalent to Windows.,,"Reviewed in Canada on December 18, 2024","If you transition from Windows laptops to Apple laptops, even those with high configurations, you may be surprised to find that it feels like a cross between a tablet and a Windows laptop in terms of the operating system, functions, and productivity abilities. Therefore, you shouldn't expect too much, as most of its applications are not on par with those available on Windows. Additionally, there are numerous limitations compared to Windows; for example, even its file explorer is not compatible with Windows Explorer. However, when it comes to battery life and screen quality, it truly deserves praise and will meet your needs and expectations regarding battery performance.

    Great Huge Laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024","I like this laptop’s real estate. It is massive, bright, and perfect for my at home use. I am in an online program and my 14” laptop was beginning to be cumbersome. I love this size because I am able to open plenty of windows side by side.

    A good midrange laptop with a bad keyboard",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024","A good midrange laptop. Nothing fantastic, everything is fairly basic, but it is decent for the price. The core memory and storage capacity (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) are perfect midrange specs, and will be exactly what the majority of PC users need. Certainly isn't a gaming laptop, but that is clearly not the market it is aimed at.  Works well for upgrading older, less tech savvy individuals to Windows 11, with the larger screen and decent basic specs.Only Major complaint is HP's AWFUL keyboard layout. Moving the power button to the keyboard is one of the dumbest decisions I have ever seen. I've bought HP laptops for multiple people in recent years, every time there was major confusion over the power button, and I have received repeated complaints about the power button from every person who uses it.The power button is hard to find when first opening the computer, and easy to press by accident during normal use. For some reason they decided to place it in the center of the top row, right next to the delete and backspace keys, some of the most commonly used keys, making it very easy to press while typing. Just putting it in the far right hand corner of the keyboard would be a major improvement. It basically forces you to disable the power button in the windows settings, which makes turning the thing off more awkward. The arrow keys are also bad, (particularly for people that regularly use them in excel, apparently), they are half height and awkward to use, with it being easy to press the wrong direction, or both simultaneously.Bloatware is at a relative minimum, still contains some useless junk but I didn't see anything particularly bad, like borderline adware or trial antivirus software, and there wasn't anything resource intensive running at startup.",31,all,"A good midrange laptop.

    Solid laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","I have been wanting a laptop to take on trips in order to RDP to my servers using Citrix Workspace and this fits the bill especially with the large 17.3 inch screen. My work laptop is a 15 inch, and the 2 extra inches is nice. This is also lighter than my work laptop. For the past four days I used this for work, I sat at a desk for half the time and couch or bed the other half. At no time while on the couch or bed did I feel it got too hot for my legs. The battery was averaging 6 hrs of constant use. The sound was decent for a laptop. I won’t go over specs as they are already available.It took around 40 minutes to get logged in and completely setup and I added Chrome, Office XP, Teams, Citrix and used my PC onedrive image of my desktop. Once all logged in, I shut off the PC and did 3 boot up tests, booting in 23 seconds. I then did dl/ul tests connecting to Ookla, I have TMobile home internet, scored 683 dl/57 ul wirelessly connected. For reference, my PC has never gotten above 540/50. I installed Filmora to edit a few drone videos, I don’t do heavy editing, but this laptop handled exporting my edited videos in maybe 2 minutes slower than my 7950x3d.I do not plan on using this for any gaming, but for giggles I tried it. I installed WorldOfTanks and played 5 games. I ran 3 games full screen and two windowed. I ran at “low” graphics” I believe minimal is one step lower. I was averaging 65-70 fps (pic) and pinging 75ms (normal ping for me). As you can see in the AMD performance pic, I was maxing the GPU, but the CPU was running 10-15% and memory was running around 50%. I was impressed. The game ran smoothly at that with no frame drops, I did have a couple latency hiccups but that is normal for my PC as well. After my game session I tested for heat temps. The left middle was the hottest @ 95F which is very reasonable.

    Huge display, but thin & light; a weak GPU, but otherwise excellent performance",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2024","The quick summary is that this is an excellent big-display, lightweight, business/coding laptop, but it is not tuned for gaming. Details follow...This laptop comes with a single-page somewhat generic instruction sheet and an AC adapter. It is the absolute bare minimum documentation, but it is enough to get you started. After charging the laptop, you need an internet connection and about half an hour to complete the initial configuration of Windows. Once the basic Windows 11 system was configured, I tried asking the AI-enhanced Microsoft Edge browser how to install and configure some additional open-source software and it kept giving me directions for how to do those things with Windows 10 -- directions that mostly don't work on Windows 11. Fortunately, ordinary internet searches found valid answers...The AMD Ryzen 5 7520U processor is relatively fast, with four cores (eight threads) normally running at 2795MHz. 16GB RAM is enough for most business and/or programming uses. The 512GB SSD is fast and big enough for most purposes although it's easy to fill if you work with a lot of high-resolution images and/or video -- it is best to think of the SSD as workspace for images and videos you will archive elsewhere when done editing. The built-in Radeon GPU handles business graphics and image and video editing nicely, and is OK for accelerating some AI processing, but it isn't up to running high-end 3D games at full resolution.The screen itself is huge, with a diagonal of 17.3"" for the active area. Initially, I was a bit concerned that the 1920x1080 resolution might look a little coarse because I'm used to a laptop with a 4K 16.5"" display. However, this laptop's display has a nice matte finish, which avoids the reflections seen with my older laptop's 4K screen, is visible from wide viewing angles (see photo), and the resolution difference isn't obvious from a normal viewing distance. This display is particularly well-suited for giving presentations to small groups or watching videos. When I'm coding or writing research papers, I like to have two full pages of text side-by-side on the display, and that also works fine for this laptop. I had no problems while using my Ubuntu Linux-based software development environment on this laptop under Windows WSL (note that Ubuntu for WSL is a free install available from Microsoft's App Store).The keyboard is slightly recessed but has a good feel. The touchpad is also large and works well. I had no problems with the WiFi or other interfaces. The built-in webcam works fine with Zoom and just about any webcam software (it supports the driverless UVC protocol), but the image quality is a little disappointing, especially in poor lighting. On the other hand, I have to complement HP on the very well-thought-out sliding privacy cover integrated into the webcam.Physically, despite the huge display, this unit is quite thin and weighs a little under 4.5 pounds -- a weight you'd expect to reach only with a smaller screen. The metal case looks nice and doesn't feel flimsy, but I'd be a bit concerned that it could easily get scratched, so you might want to put it in a laptop sleeve before throwing it in your backpack. The included AC adapter is also small enough to carry easily, although you'll want to carry it on trips because it uses a power plug like older HP laptops rather than a generic USB C charger input. Battery life seems very good, as you'd expect for a TDP 15W processor, although it's hard to quote a typical runtime because there are so many power management options. Incidentally, the power button is the function key sixth from the right on the keyboard -- I had to read their one-page instruction sheet to find the power button.  ;-)In sum, I highly recommend this laptop for business and/or programming use. The desktop computers I use all have 4K 43"" displays, so I'm used to the benefits of seeing lots of stuff on the display all at once; this 17.3"" display comes much closer to that experience than most laptops without sacrificing portability, performance, or battery life. The main downsides are the relatively weak GPU and the fact that none of the hardware is trivially upgradeable.",13,all,"The quick summary is that this is an excellent big-display, lightweight, business/coding laptop, but it is not tuned for gaming.

    Good quality Laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024","I ordered the HP 17.3"" laptop for home office use, and I am extremely happy the overall performance.  This laptop is user friendly, has plenty of power, ample storage, and has excellent graphics.These are my favorite features of this laptop:- The computer boots right up and has no issues with latency.  While I wouldn't go as far as classifying this as a gaming computer, it does perform well when it comes to Teams calls, watching Netflix, browsing on the internet, and everything in between.- The speakers are crystal clear and the camera produces high quality video.  I'm on a lot of Teams calls throughout the day, and I am very pleased with the overall performance of the audio and video.  It's also nice that the camera has a built in shutter to ensure privacy while not on a call.  The shutter has a white screen when it is closed, making it easy to identify when the shutter is open or closed.- I really appreciate the size of the keyboard and the screen.  That has always been one of the pitfalls of using a laptop for me.  I don't like working on smaller screens, especially since I am used to having two screens on my desktop computer.  The larger screen makes it so much easier to multi-task and work with spreadsheets.  Same goes for the keyboard.

    Serviceable computer for basic use",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024","Even before this computer arrived, I was impressed by its specs relative to price.  I love the AMD Ryzen series and have installed one of their CPUs in the last half dozen or so computers I've built.  The AMD Radeon graphics is pretty good for an integrated solution but just can't deliver the goods like a discrete GPU.  Then again, you could add a good chunk of change to the price of this laptop were you to add a GPU.I don't really like the trend toward LPDDR5 RAM.  I understand the upside it has in a laptop but don't like the way it precludes upgrading.  That said, 16 GB and a 512 SSD drive is enough for general use.  The webcam is fine--particularly for a consumer audience.  It's really offers solid specs and performance at the price point.Kudos to HP for not going overboard with bloatware and other useless apps.  On the other hand, the experience of installing and using Windows is as miserable as ever.  One of the great things about Ubuntu (the OS of choice on my laptop and desktop) is that it doesn't try to sell me something every time I turn on my PC.  Making the Windows 11 experience even worse is the difficulty in configuring the UI.  The first thing I did was try and remove the news feed and other useless feeds.  It took several attempts and three restarts.  The fact that MSFT makes it so hard to configure my own operating system is absurd.  It's even more absurd that Windows makes it so difficult for a large audience of general consumer users.  If a 'power user' with plenty of tech knowledge such as myself has to jump through endless hoops just to make the OS look and act the way I want to I can only imagine how 'average users' feel.All of the bloatware and other nonsense that comes with Windows 11 is a shame since the OS itself is IMO the best they've released since WinXP.  If you're fairly tech savvy there's ways to significantly reduce or eliminate the bloatware, the burdensome resource overhead and the endless sales pitches but they definitely don't make it easy for the end user.Ultimately, however, the hardware isn't the OS--even if the OS drives the user experience.  Generally, when I review a computer I can immediately name a good 'target market' that should consider it.  This one isn't so easy.  Most average users don't need a 17"" screen anymore.  With smaller bezels and better display quality you can get the same visual experience with a 16"" or smaller device. I've seen 14"" devices with more actual screen space than the 15"" laptops of just a few years ago.  A secondary problem with such a big screen is that it makes the laptop bulky.  The weight isn't so much the problem as the heft due to the overall size.  My primary laptop is a 15"" but I also have a 16"" device that I use for some content creation tasks.  I was amazed at how much bulkier the 17"" laptop feels even though given the comparable size it probably shouldn't.One market segment that can benefit from a larger screen is gaming enthusiasts but the lack of a discrete GPU and lack of RAM upgrade possibilities doesn't lend itself to this demographic.  It might be a decent desktop replacement for office use, assuming mostly basic tasks.  For example, my mom is a real estate agent and the overwhelming majority of her computer work is emails, research, taking notes, etc.  These specs would be great for her as would the bigger screen.  She doesn't need to drive around all day carrying her laptop and it spends 90+ percent of the time on her desk.  That makes the overall heft of the HP laptop a non-issue.Of course, my inability to come up with good 'target markets' for this laptop doesn't really matter.  If you like the larger screen (with the corresponding larger form factor) and don't need any heavy duty speed or processing power this is a great choice--particularly at the price point.  The price point also makes it a good choice for a teenager who just wants to watch videos and email, or a parent/relative that would benefit from a larger screen and doesn't need 'bleeding edge' tech capability, etc.  Overall, a great price for impressive specs in a very servicable laptop.

For example, my mom is a real estate agent and the overwhelming majority of her computer work is emails, research, taking notes, etc. These specs would be great for her as would the bigger screen. She doesn't need to drive around all day carrying her laptop and it spends 90+ percent of the time on her desk. That makes the overall heft of the HP laptop a non-issue.Of course, my inability to come up with good 'target markets' for this laptop doesn't really matter. If you like the larger screen (with the corresponding larger form factor) and don't need any heavy duty speed or processing power this is a great choice--particularly at the price point. The price point also makes it a good choice for a teenager who just wants to watch videos and email, or a parent/relative that would benefit from a larger screen and doesn't need 'bleeding edge' tech capability, etc. Overall, a great price for impressive specs in a very servicable laptop.

    Easy to set up, fast, zero complaints!",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2024","I've been trying to separate my work computer equipment from home and that is where this comes in. I am really impressed!It took almost nothing to set up. I could live without the Microsoft takeover attempts (am not an Edge fan) but it's easy enough to set up defaults. I had no problem connecting to our wifi and it happily moves between wifi signals if I want it to. This almost seems faster than my work computer, which is amazing and good!Here's the really fantastic thing. I really don't like typing on laptops and I really don't like touchpads. Just to experiment, I am using the keyboard on the laptop and the touchpad and it is working out great! I'm not accidentally putting my wrist on the touchpad and I have no problems at all moving around the screen. The keyboard on this laptop is responsive and is easy to type on. The keys feel good (it's a thing with me) and no matter how fast I get going, I haven't typo'd.I've watched a few videos and it's great, no lag time if I'm streaming.I am really happy with this computer.

    Fantastic large screen HP Laptop",5.0,"Reviewed in the United States on April 24, 2024","I am very happy with my new HP laptop, first impressions were very good - as I really appreciate the sustainable, low environmental impact packaging. The packaging worked great, the laptop arrived safe and sound without the need for a bunch of styrofoam packing inserts.The laptop itself is well built, and well equipped (16GB of RAM isn't incredible but it is definitely sufficient for most home/business users). It boots up super fast, the 17 inch screen feels massive, and looks great (bright, crispy and low glare). As far as performance the laptop was able to handle everything we threw at it. It works great for watching online video, web surfing and my son's had no problem playing a variety of PC games via steam. The keyboard action feels great while typing, and I had no problem acclimating to the button layout.Overall: Another impressive HP laptop, with excellent performance at a fantastic price! Highly recommended for those looking for a large screen laptop for your home or office use. Especially great for streaming movies (nice big screen but still very portable). 5-stars!",0,all,"I am very happy with my new HP laptop, first impressions were very good - as I really appreciate the sustainable, low environmental impact packaging.

    Not the best value, but the cost is up because of screen size.",4.0,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","First, there are better laptops for the cost but you will be seeing 14 and 15 inch screens when looking for those. This is a mediocre performing 17 screen but it is a excellent 17 inch 1080p screen.You can play some games on it on the lowest settings, but that isn't why you get this guy. You get it because of the screen size and work.As a work computer, there are somethings that are also mediocre. The ram isn't the problem as the 7520u processor was upgraded to support DDR5... however, the 7520u processor is... also mediocre, wherein the processor is a Zen 2 processor with only 4 cores and 8 threads (8 threads total as each core hosts two threads.) The Zen 2 is a functional processor node though, but it is a old one. Think back on the Ryzen 3000 series processors. There is a light though, though dim, and that is the RDNA 2 gpu. It is a onboard 610M gpu, which is standard in the 7000 lineup that are not G series processors. It has 128 stream processors (Unified Shader Cores, think CUDA from NVidia) This is not a lot of gpu power though as a G series processor could have up to 768 stream processors. What is weird is that they added 2 ray tracing cores onto this GPU which confuses me as I see nothing that would work well with and likely this is ripped from a larger GPU cluster and made into a module.This is great though for video, web based games, and things like accounting or other work requiring numbers or typing. There is a number pad and another mediocre part, the keyboard. There is a lot of flex in the keyboard, especially in the middle. I opened it up to find minimal bracing and the motherboard directly below the keyboard so no hulk smash of the keyboard less you want a broken one.Interesting notes though, there isn't much for upgrades here. You can upgrade the network card and the NVME SSD drive. Repairability is higher though, with separate daughter board for the Left I/O ports (usb, audio) as well as the power port not being on the motherboard, making the proprietary cord for power a bit easier to repair in the future if or when it breaks. Though I do wish that they allowed for charging through the USB port... that was a letdown to find it does not charge through the USB-C port, which means I can not use my dock to charge it. (Also means they did not make use of USBC 4 which is not native to the Processor, which only support 3.2 gen 1.)Opening it up though did reveal a good system for removing heat, allowing that there is proper clearance under the unit. I was happy with the cooling solution though, and even think it was more than actually required. The motherboard used quality parts, and I love that they are repurposing a battery for a more universal fit situation. This decreases cost for HP and increases options for repair in the future. The SSD was a samsung unit, looked like it was a all in one controller with a side DDR memory module. (either that or the module was the controller and it was DDRless) But I trust Samsung as a part and think this is a good one to have. (All in one controller for NVME means that both the NVME processor and memory are found on one unit, first instance I found of this was small NVME units from Kioxia, formerly known as Toshiba.) Inside the HP there wasn't anything I was really disappointed at though with one exception.The exception was the screen hinges. The hinge system reminded me of HP engineering of the late 2000's. Think 2008-2010. HP was one of the worst companies at that point as a tech that had to repair them, but by 2011 I was seeing more and more options that were great. Getting back to the hinges, there may not be a problem if they tuned the tension correctly. However, they are using the same setup of metal inside plastic housing and I have seen so many times how that fails requiring replacement of part of the laptops body and sometimes even the screen or wire harness. There is no additional bracing to prevent flex in the area as well, though the bottom is deep and works well.Another thing, repairing this will require that you remove the bottom feet to access five hidden screws. Once out, and tight line on the upper section of the body attaches the bottom to the top of the body assembly via clips. Guitar picks and plastic pry tools will be required to gently coax the two halves apart. The good news is, you only have to open this unit up for repairs only, and likely well past the warranty. There is no major reason to be accessing the inside when so little inside is capable of upgrades or replacement.The screen on this 17 inch laptop is actually the best part of this unit. Things like keyboard flex and unmentioned till now key mushiness are likely the worst things for this laptop. Other things like underwhelming processor are more of a AMD thing, though is a great entry to a new laptop. When I first got this, they were talking about $750 for the price and that is not worth it, now it is $599 as of writing this while not being on sale and that is a better price though I was thinking $550 when I was looking at it part wise so I was close. Only thing I would be considering as a worry point is those screen hinges though. I would love to see some sort of structural brace inside these in the future though where that would help with the keyboard flex.Little bonus, this unit does have a built in Camera shutter so you can manually close the camera off. Sound on this isn't stellar, but it is good overall for what it is. I can recommend it at 599, but with the caveat of watching the pressure you put on the screen when opening it. If you do want better than this laptop, you will be looking at either smaller ones, older models, or larger cost units.",23,all,"First, there are better laptops for the cost but you will be seeing 14 and 15 inch screens when looking for those.
