# Abstract

**What I Have Done:** I have introduced the overall goals of my project in the Background section, discussing the challenge of detecting hidden positive sentiment in customer reviews using transformer-based NLP models.

**What I Need to Do:** I will draft a dedicated abstract (within 200 words) that clearly summarizes:

*   **The Problem:** The difficulty of uncovering subtle positive sentiment in low-rated reviews.
    
*   **My Methods:** The use of models like BERT and RoBERTa compared to traditional methods (e.g., lexicon-based approaches, SVM).
    
*   **Preliminary Results:** Initial insights from my exploratory data analysis, including shortcomings of methods like VADER.
    
*   **Future Work:** My plan for further model tuning, quantitative evaluation (using metrics like accuracy and F1-score), and extended testing.
    

# 2. Introduction
----------------

**What I Have Done:** I have clearly outlined my research problem, objectives, and theoretical challenges. I’ve introduced the idea of hidden sentiment in mixed reviews and explained why it is a critical issue.

**What I Need to Do:** I will expand this section by:

*   Emphasizing the real-world impact of detecting hidden sentiment, such as enhancing customer insights and improving targeted marketing strategies.
    
*   Addressing commercial and technical risks I face, like the scalability of my Chrome extension, potential model biases, and data privacy concerns.
    
*   Highlighting the novelty of my approach, particularly how I plan to combine aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with transformer models to capture subtle sentiment cues.
    

3\. Literature Review
---------------------

**What I Have Done:**I have built a solid foundation by citing key studies related to transformer-based models, traditional sentiment analysis, and ABSA. I have demonstrated the limitations of conventional methods in detecting implicit sentiment.

**What I Need to Do:**I will strengthen this section by:

*   Critically comparing existing work and explicitly identifying the gaps that my research addresses. For example, I will clarify, “Unlike traditional lexicon approaches, my transformer-based method is designed to capture implicit sentiment.”
    
*   Removing redundant citations (e.g., limiting multiple references to Hoang et al.) and incorporating additional recent studies (from 2023–2024) to diversify the source material.
    
*   Clearly linking the literature gaps to my project’s objectives.
    

4\. Methodology
---------------

**What I Have Done:**I have described my current approach to data collection using a custom-built Chrome extension, preprocessing techniques, and my initial setup for implementing transformer-based models (such as BERT and RoBERTa) using tools like Hugging Face and PyTorch.

**What I Need to Do:**I will expand on my methodology by:

*   Explaining why I chose specific models and tools (e.g., why I opted for BERT over DistilBERT) and how these choices help address the challenge of detecting hidden sentiment.
    
*   Outlining my planned testing and validation strategies, such as cross-validation, baseline comparisons (using tools like VADER and SVM), and the performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall) I will use to evaluate my models.
    
*   Ensuring that all methodological choices are directly aligned with my research objectives.
    

5\. Quality & Results
---------------------

**What I Have Done:**I have conducted preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated word clouds, and examined sentiment distributions in a dataset of approximately 50,000 Amazon reviews.

**What I Need to Do:**I will finalize my results by:

*   Completing the model training process and presenting detailed quantitative metrics (such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall) in tables and charts.
    
*   Critically analyzing the results, discussing both the strengths and limitations of my approach.
    
*   Addressing dataset biases (e.g., overrepresentation of electronics reviews) and discussing how these might affect the outcomes.
    

6\. Evaluation & Conclusion
---------------------------

**What I Have Done:**I have begun planning my hypothesis testing, particularly comparing transformer models against traditional methods, and I have reflected on early challenges such as API restrictions.

**What I Need to Do:**I will develop a comprehensive evaluation by:

*   Reflecting on the overall feasibility of my project, including any limitations I encounter (like computational costs or dataset biases).
    
*   Writing a thorough conclusion that synthesizes my findings, links them back to my original research objectives, and provides clear recommendations for future work (for example, exploring multilingual sentiment analysis or improving model interpretability).
    

# References
--------------

**What I Have Done:**I have collected a set of relevant studies, including research on BERT, ABSA, and implicit sentiment analysis. My references are currently in Harvard style, but there are some inconsistencies.

**What I Need to Do:**I will:

*   Remove duplicate citations (for instance, reducing multiple references to Hoang et al. to a single entry).
    
*   Format all references consistently in Harvard style, ensuring that I include DOIs or URLs for preprints and journal articles (e.g., for arXiv papers like arXiv:2111.02194).
    
*   Expand the reference list by including additional high-quality and recent studies from reputable sources such as ACL and IEEE.
    

8\. Appendices
--------------

**What I Have Done:**I have included initial appendices with code snippets, a preliminary Gantt chart, and some sample figures (e.g., dataset preview).

**What I Need to Do:**I will enhance this section by:

*   Adding a formal declaration, a cover page, and a list of figures/tables.
    
*   Expanding the supporting materials to include comprehensive documentation, such as a detailed Gantt chart, sample outputs from my models, and additional code documentation.
    
*   Creating a README.md for my GitHub repository that provides an overview, setup instructions, usage examples, links to key files (report, code, datasets), a LICENSE file, and a requirements.txt for documenting dependencies.
    

Final Notes and Target Grade Band
---------------------------------

**My Current Progress:**I estimate that my work is currently in the 60–69% range. I have built a solid foundation but still need to address gaps in critical analysis, justify my methodological choices, and refine my presentation.

**To Achieve a Grade of 70–89% (Excellent/Very Good):**I will ensure that every section is complete, well-justified, and critically analyzed. I plan to:

*   Provide in-depth connections between objectives, methods, and results.
    
*   Use high-quality, recent references and ensure error-free, professional writing.
    
*   Present clear figures, tables, and comprehensive supporting documentation.
    

**To Reach 90–100% (Outstanding):**I aim to innovate in my methodology and results, such as incorporating a novel dataset or state-of-the-art model comparisons. I will provide exceptional depth in my literature review and evaluation, ensuring flawless alignment between my research objectives, methods, and outcomes.
